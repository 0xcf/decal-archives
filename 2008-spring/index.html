<h1>Unix System Administration DeCal</h1>

<p>Welcome to the website for the Unix System Administration DeCal for Spring 2008!  We offer two sections of this course, aimed at students of different ability levels.  For more information, visit the web pages for the individual sections below.</p>

<h2>Sections</h2>

<p><b>All sections share the same CCNs.</b>  Lower division students should take CS 98, section 15, CCN 26229; upper-division students should take CS 198, section 15, CCN 26231.</p>

<p>Note that the time and location given by TeleBEARS and the schedule of classes is not necessarily correct for your section; the times and locations below (and hopefully on the decal.org website) should be correct.</p>

<p>Intended for students comfortable with the Unix shell; prior system administration experience is helpful, though not required.  Learn about the structure, operation, and maintenance of Unix operating systems.  Emphasis on understanding how it works, not just how to do it.
