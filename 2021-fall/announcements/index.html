    <p>Hi everyone!</p>

<p>Lab 11 is now released and available on the Decal website <a href="https://decal.ocf.berkeley.edu/labs/11/">here</a>. Lab 11 is <strong>completely optional</strong> and can be used to replace another lab you haven’t done for full credit if desired (i.e. you just need to complete any 10 labs).</p>

<p>Lab 11 is applicable to both tracks, and involves writing a Puppet script to auto-provision a Minecraft server!</p>

<p>This will also be the very last lab of the semester. <strong>All labs, including late labs and Lab 11, will have a final due date of Sunday, December 12 at 11:59pm</strong> (the weekend before finals). This will allow us to have time to process and submit grades.</p>

<p>We are very much hoping to give everyone credit for participating this semester! If the deadline is approaching and you feel like you are unable to complete the required labs, please either send us an email at decal@ocf.berkeley.edu or make a private Piazza post, and we will do what we can to accommodate your situation.</p>

<p>Hope y’all have an awesome Thanksgiving, and feel free to reply with any questions you have!</p>
