<P><DD><font size=-1>(03/04/02) </font>&nbsp;&nbsp; Classroom location update:  
class will be held in the Pepperwood room on the 4th floor of <a
href=http://www.berkeley.edu/map/maps/DE34.html>MLK Student Union</a> from now on,
except for on 5/1 (we'll go back to the lab or find another place for that day).
Same day of the week, same time of day.  <P>

<DD>Linux install feedback.  There was some question about the debian media, and 
if disks 2 or 3 are needed.  Supposedly those disks contain packages and
sourcefile for tertiary programs that you might want to install, but are not
required for the base OS install.  <P>

<P><DD><font size=-1>(02/28/02) </font> &nbsp;&nbsp; The linux installation box is now up!  It's living
over by the microwave in front of the whiteboard.  Go ahead and start using it to install linux, or
optionally you can try FreeBSD or OpenBSD.  If you have trouble, ask a staffer or read a "<a
href=http://www.linuxdoc.org/LDP/gs/gs.html>Linux Installation HOW-TO</a>" or email me.  I'll be around the
lab off and on Friday afternoon, and available by email to swing by if you're really stuck.  You'll need
to bring a floppy disk, or scrounge one from the lab, to make a boot floppy (because the pentium that we're using is so old
that its bios doesn't support booting directly off the cd-rom).  <P>

<P><DD><font size=-1>(02/27/02) </font> &nbsp;&nbsp; It's now officially too late to sign up.
We had our first meeting today (Wednesday, Feb 27th) from 11-12 in the OCF lab in the back of Heller Lounge.<P>

<font color=red>OCF Staff Orientation Meeting</font> at Thursday, Feb 29, 7pm in 204 Wheeler.  If
you're interested in gaining useful systems administration experience, come to this meeting and
look into joining OCF staff.  The OCF runs Sun, Linux and Windows 2000, and has one of the largest
userbases on campus, and has been run by student vollunteers since it was created in 1989!  It's a
fun and lively community, and many of our former staffers have gone on to find lucrative work in
the IT industry.<P>

The <a href=2002-02-27.html>notes</a> are now online, you can click on the topic heading above too.<P>

The OCF Lab is busy at this hour, so I'll arrange a classroom to meet in for next week and the rest of the
semester.  Check back here for more information.<P>

According to my sign-in sheet, we have 5 people enrolling, and 8 others auditing.  Auditors are welcome, but if
anyone forgot to give me their SID on the course sign-in sheet, please email me so I know that you're actually
signed up.  Likewise, if you signed in, but forgot to have Wayne or I sign your add-form, email me and we can
arrange a time or just do it next week.<P>

<DD><font size=-1>(02/21/02) </font> &nbsp;&nbsp; It's not too late to sign up.  We're having our first 
official meeting 
next 
Wednesday, Feb 27th, from 11-12 in the OCF lab in the back of Heller Lounge.<P>

We're considering running the course on a mostly self-paced basis, with as much or as little instructor 
time as the students require.  Progress and grading will be measured by homework.<P>

If you're interested in learning how to run a webserver, or simply in how to administer a unix system, I 
welcome you to mail me for the course control numbers.  

If you need my signiture to sign up before the end of the 5th week of classes (if you're an engineering,
chemistry or optometry major, I think your colleges don't accept changes to your schedule after the end of
the 5th week of classes) you can meet with me today (Friday) between 11-12 when I'll be in the OCF lab.  
If that doesn't work out for you, email me to arrange a meeting before 3:30 (i believe the offices close at
4).  If it's not urgent, you can get your form signed at the first class meeting next wednesday!
