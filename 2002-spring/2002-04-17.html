<h3>
Basic Security
</h3>

stopping unneeded services:
	
disabling telnet and ftp: 
(after making sure ssh is up and running, even after reboot) 

Why disable telnet and ftp?  Even though telnet and ftp are old services,
there are new bugs and exploits being found for versions of these utilites
on an ongoing basis.  Besides new problems cropping up, there is a
fundemental problem with those two protocols in that they transmit your
password in plaintext over the net when you log in, allowing anyone who is
surreptitiously watching the network to learn your password as the bits zoom
by.  The ssh and scp protocols have been created to replace telnet and ftp
respectively and address this problem.  Be sure to install and configure 
sshd before disabling telnet and ftp unless you don't intend to support 
remote access.

The inet daemon starts the telnet and ftp services, and the file
/etc/inetd.conf controls which services inetd spawns on which ports. We
commented these services out and restarted inetd as specified in the file
itself.

From a inetd.conf file in which telnet has been turned off (note the #'s 
before the telnet line):

# These are standard services.
#
ftp    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  in.ftpd -l -a
<font color=red>#</font>telnet stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  in.telnetd

inetd then needs to be told to reload it's configuration: (kill -HUP
<i>inetd's PID</i>).

To confirm that you successfully turned off a service, try to telnet to that 
service's port (you can find what service is running on which port by 
looking in /etc/inet/services or /etc/services):

Telnet usually lives on port 23:
telnet localhost 23


<h3>CGI basics</h3>
As a website admin, it's useful to know how Common Gateway Interface (CGI) 
scripts work.  CGI is the generic name for programs that are run on the server 
to process forms or dynamically generate content.

Some examples:

<LI><a href="http://death.berkeley.edu/~jones/sysadmin-2002-cgi/echo.cgi">Prints some text.</a>
<LI><a href="http://death.berkeley.edu/~jones/sysadmin-2002-cgi/sayhello.cgi">Creates a form and responds to different input.</a> 
<LI><a href="http://death.berkeley.edu/~jones/sysadmin-2002-cgi/date.cgi">Displays the current time.</a>
