Special thanks to <A href="http://sartre.dgate.org/~brg/">Brian Gaeke</a> for help compiling this list.

web browsing
 - mozilla for reasonable hardware
   - plugins for realplayer, flash, java, acrobat
   - interface using preferences-->applications to mplayer, etc. for
     other kinds of content
   - netscape6 is slightly faster version of mozilla, similar
     functionality, not updated very often with bugfixes or anything
     else
 - galeon, konqueror are popular alternatives
 - netscape4 is just not recommended unless your system is groaningly
   slow with mozilla - it crashes too much.

session tools
 - screen - keeps your console programs running after you log out
 - ssh-agent - helps you not have to type things 

office tools
 - OpenOffice (free version of Sun's StarOffice)
   - microsoft converters - usually works for read-only
 - KOffice (KDE version)
 - Abiword
 - Gnumeric spreadsheet
 - Gnuplot (charting tools, commandline based)
 - mozilla Composer (web page authoring)
 - for the resolutely oldschool: emacs, xemacs, TeX

   files)

 - netpbm (image conversion)
 - xv, xli, or imagemagick's "display" to put up random backgrounds

instant messaging
 - gaim - AOL Instant Messenger

sound
 - picking which driver is right
   - oss vs alsa support

     application

video
 - mplayer - playing movies
 - linuxvideo.org - DVD tools
 - broadcast2000 - video editing (can be tricky to find; sacrifice
   chicken to google)
 - quicktime under wine

window managers
 - simple - blackbox, twm
   - saves memory, faster, simpler to configure because there are fewer knobs
 - complex - gnome, kde
   - lots of fancy new apps depend on gnome and kde
   - run them under simple WMs too, but YMMV.
   - offers stuff like application bar, menu on desktop, file manager 

games
 - id software: quake, doom, quake2, quake3 Arena
   - various commercial + free addons + patches to the above generally work

 - tuxracer
 - console games: nethack, etc.

windows stuff
 - wine
   - for using windows apps, eg old versions of Winword, etc.
     - kind of medium to low reliability
     - for best results, use with O.G. Win95 or Win98 DLLs on a separate
       mounted DOS partition (some ppl even can run I.E. with this)
 - samba
   - for sharing your files with windows over the network
 - vmware
   - for running windows (or linux) inside of linux (pay $$$)
