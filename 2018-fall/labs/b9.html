<title>Lab 9 - Version Control and Backups - Hands-On Linux System Administration DeCal</title>

<article class="markdown-body">
  <h1>Lab 9 - Version Control and Backups</h1>
  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>In this lab, we’ll be talking about using version control, in particular Git, for keeping track of changes to your files and backing up your files to other machines. 
We’ll be setting up <a href="http://gitolite.com/gitolite/index.html">Gitolite</a>, an open-source Git server that allows you to host Git repositories on other machines,
and set access to Git repositories hosted on the Gitolite server.</p>

<h2 id="a-git-primer">A Git Primer</h2>

<p>Version control tools are designed to keep track of changes to files, and allow you to rewind to some last saved state. 
Git, as one of the most popular version control tools in use today, supports these features, but also allows for more advanced workflows such as splitting a filebase into “branches” for experimentation.
In order to complete this lab, you’ll need to know a few basic git commands and some terminology.</p>

<h3 id="getting-started-in-git-initializingcloning-a-repository">Getting started in git: Initializing/cloning a repository</h3>

<p>A “repository” is just a fancy way of saying “a folder where git is set up.”
In order to start working with git, you’ll need to either create a repository from scratch,
or “clone” (download and copy) a repository from somewhere else.</p>

<p>A folder can be made into a git <strong>repository</strong> by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">git init</code>, telling git that files under the folder can start being tracked by git. When a repository is initialized, git creates a hidden <code class="highlighter-rouge">.git</code> folder within the root folder to track the files’ histories.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bzh@tsunami ~$ mkdir example-project
bzh@tsunami ~$ cd example-project/
bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/b/bz/bzh/example-project/.git/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A git repository can also be <strong>cloned</strong> from online by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">git clone [repository url]</code>, which will create a copy of the repository
on your machine, and set the address you cloned the repo from to be the “origin” remote (more on this later).</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bzh@tsunami /tmp$ git clone https://github.com/ocf/ocfweb.git

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="adding-files-to-git">Adding files to git</h3>

<p>Now that you have a git repository on your local machine, you’ll want
to use it start tracking file history, yeah?
However, files do not have their histories recorded by git by default. In order to tell git to start recording changes made to a file, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">git add [file]</code> within a repository.</p>

<p>In git parlance, a file added through <code class="highlighter-rouge">git add</code> is called a “tracked file”,
and all other files in a repository are “untracked files”.
Git doesn’t track every file in a repository by default because codebases tend to accumulate a lot of cruft
–temporary files, build files, caches, and secrets that would take up
a lot of space if tracked by git.</p>

<p>Basically: only add the files you care about.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ ls
file1  file2  file3  subdir/

bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ ls subdir/
cruft.pyc  script.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Add a single file:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git add file1

bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

	new file:   file1

Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

	file2
	file3
	subdir/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Add multiple files at once:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git add file2 file3

bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git status
On branch master

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

	new file:   file1
	new file:   file2
	new file:   file3

Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

	subdir/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Add a directory (be careful when using this, since it will add everything within the directory*, which can include cruft files).</p>

<p><sub><sup>*except for things added to <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore">.gitignore</a>.</sup></sub></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git add subdir

bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

	new file:   file1
	new file:   file2
	new file:   file3
	new file:   subdir/cruft.pyc
	new file:   subdir/script.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="committing">Committing</h3>

<p>git groups a set of changes into a <strong>commit</strong>.
Tracked files in a git repository do not have their contents saved in git until <code class="highlighter-rouge">git commit</code> is run.
You can think of <code class="highlighter-rouge">git commit</code> as creating a snapshot of all modifications made to tracked files since the last commit.</p>

<p>In almost every case, you’ll want to use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-m "&lt;message&gt;"</code> flag when making a commit, describing the changes you made in that commit.</p>

<p>Committing often is <strong>very important</strong>.
The basic unit of history in git is the commit, so you can’t roll back changes that were made in between commits,
and if you delete something that hasn’t been committed in a long time, you’re out of luck.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

<h3 id="adding-files-again-staging">Adding files (again): Staging</h3>

<p>If you’ve added and committed some files, and then modified them <strong>after the commit</strong>, even though the files are tracked, git will not automatically add them to the next commit. You’ll need to “stage” them by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">git add</code> again.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bzh@tsunami ~/example-project&gt; echo "hello" $ file1

bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   file1

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git add file1

bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

	modified:   file1
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="branching">Branching</h3>

<p>Imagine that you want to develop a new feature, <code class="highlighter-rouge">feature1</code>, in <code class="highlighter-rouge">example_project</code>.
However, the feature would require a lot of time and change many files in <code class="highlighter-rouge">example_project</code>,
and you don’t want to break the project while you’re working on the feature. What can you do?
You could add the feature in a single giant commit, but that runs directly counter to the philosophy of “commit early, commit often.”</p>

<p>To solve this, git has the concept of <strong>branching</strong>. You can think of a branch as a series of commits across time.
The main branch, and the one usually reserved for stable production code is <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>.</p>

<p>You can create a new branch using <code class="highlighter-rouge">git branch [branch name]</code>; in our example, we would run:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git branch feature1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In order to start adding commits to the branch, you have to <strong>checkout the branch</strong>. This will move our “view” of the files from the parent branch to the new branch.
More technically, <code class="highlighter-rouge">git checkout [branch name]</code> shifts a marker called <code class="highlighter-rouge">HEAD</code> from the tip of the current branch to the tip of the new branch.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean

bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git checkout feature1
Switched to branch 'feature1'

bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git status
On branch feature1
nothing to commit, working tree clean
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can combine the “create new branch, then checkout” commands by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">git checkout -b [branch name]</code>.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve checked out the new branch, you can make commits to it, and those commits won’t show up in the parent branch, and vice versa.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ ls
file1  file2  file3  subdir/

bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git rm file1
rm 'file1'

bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git commit -m "removed file1."
[feature1 e80901d] removed file1.
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 delete mode 100644 file1

bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ ls
file2  file3  subdir/

bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'

bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ ls
file1  file2  file3  subdir/
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="merging">Merging</h3>

<p>Imagine you’ve completed <code class="highlighter-rouge">feature1</code>, and you want to use it in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch.
You can <strong>merge</strong> a branch into its parent using the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">git merge [branch you want to merge into your current branch]</code>.
This will integrate the tip of the branch into its parent’s tip, so changes from the branch show up in its parent.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean

bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ ls
file1  file2  file3  subdir/

bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git merge feature1

</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="merge-conflicts-the-worst-part-of-git">Merge conflicts: the worst part of git</h4>

<p>If you’ve edited the same file in both branches, when you try to merge them,
you’ll run into <strong>merge conflicts</strong>.
git will refuse to merge the branches together until you’ve gone to the offending files and fixed the conflicts.
This is beyond the scope of this primer, but <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/">here</a> is a good guide on it.</p>

<h3 id="rebasing-an-alternative-to-merging">Rebasing: an alternative to merging</h3>

<p>Instead of merging, you can <strong>rebase</strong> a branch on top of another one. using <code class="highlighter-rouge">git rebase [branch you want to revase on top of your current branch]</code>.
This will take all the commits you’ve made to the source branch, and apply them to the tip of the destination branch.</p>

<p>To use a tree analogy, if merging is like a branch growing back into the trunk, rebasing is like cutting off the branch, and grafting it onto the top of the trunk.</p>

<p>Many people like rebasing a lot better than merging, since rebasing will produce a nicer history.
Both have their own benefits and drawbacks, as presented nicely <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing">here</a>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'

bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ ls
file1  file2  file3  subdir/

bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git rebase feature1

 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

Fast-forwarded master to feature1.

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="a-small-aside-git-status">A small aside: <code class="highlighter-rouge">git status</code></h3>

<p>As you’ve seen, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">git status</code> command is very useful.
It displays which branch you’re on, which commit you’re viewing, tracked, untracked, staged, and unstaged files.</p>

<h3 id="pushing-and-pulling">Pushing and Pulling</h3>

<p>After you’ve made some commits, you’ll want to share them with other people,
or upload them to a production server.
In the other direction, you’ll want to periodically download changes made by other people to the repository, to keep up to date.</p>

<p>In order to do this, git has you to set <strong>remotes</strong>. A remote is, literally, another git repository that you can upload to/download from. 
To see which remotes you have, and what URLs they point to, you can run <code class="highlighter-rouge">git remote -v</code>.
Adding a remote is done by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">git remote add [remote name] [remote url]</code>.
If you’ve cloned a repository from elsewhere, you probably won’t need to do this, since the clone URL is automatically set as the “origin” remote
(which is naming convention for the primary remote of a project).</p>

<p>In order to upload changes on a local repository to a remote, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">git push [remote name] [branch name]</code>.</p>

<p>In order to download changes from a remote to a local repository, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">git pull [remote name] [branch name]</code>.</p>

<p>When you push and pull to a remote, you may end up with merge conflicts that you’ll need to fix (<em>yay</em>).</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bzh@tsunami ~/example-project$ git remote -v

<h2 id="gitolite">Gitolite</h2>

<h3 id="generating-an-ssh-key">Generating an SSH key</h3>

<p>Gitolite identifies its users through their SSH public key. Since you’ll need to interact with Gitolite from your OCF account on tsunami, in
order to complete the lab, you’ll first have to generate an SSH keypair on tsunami.</p>

<p>On <code class="highlighter-rouge">tsunami.ocf.berkeley.edu</code>, create a directory called <code class="highlighter-rouge">.ssh</code> in your home directory if it doesn’t already exist.
Within <code class="highlighter-rouge">.ssh</code>, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh-keygen</code> and hit enter until
it finishes generating a public-private keypair. You’ll need to copy the contents of <code class="highlighter-rouge">.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> later when installing Gitolite.</p>

<h3 id="installing-gitolite">Installing Gitolite</h3>

<p>Log into your <strong>DigitalOcean VM</strong> and install Gitolite using <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt</code>. The package name in the apt system is <code class="highlighter-rouge">gitolite3</code>.
When you are prompted for the administrator’s SSH key, paste in the contents of <strong>id_rsa.pub</strong> (not <code class="highlighter-rouge">id_rsa</code>!) from the key you just
generated on <code class="highlighter-rouge">tsunami</code>.
If you mess up when configuring the admin SSH key or accidentally paste in the contents of <code class="highlighter-rouge">id_rsa</code>, you can run <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo apt purge gitolite3</code>
to remove the package and all of its config files, and try installing it again.</p>

<p>After you’ve finished installing Gitolite, verify that it is running by running the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh gitolite3@[your VM's address] info</code> from
<code class="highlighter-rouge">tsunami</code>. It should produce an output similar to:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>hello admin, this is gitolite3@test running gitolite3 3.6.6-1 (Debian) on git 2.11.0

 R W	gitolite-admin
 R W	testing
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="configuring-gitolite">Configuring Gitolite</h3>

<p>Gitolite configuration, unusually, is done by cloning the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gitolite-admin</code> git repository hosted on the Gitolite server, modifying it,
and sending the updated repository back by pushing.</p>

<p>In order to clone the configuration repository to tsunami, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">git clone gitolite3@[username].decal.xcf.sh:gitolite-admin</code> from tsunami.
If all goes well, a folder called <code class="highlighter-rouge">gitolite-admin</code> will appear in your current directory.</p>

<h4 id="adding-a-new-user">Adding a New User</h4>

<p>As the administrator of the Gitolite server, you automatically get an account on the Gitolite server (Gitolite accounts are entirely separate
from Linux user accounts). For the purposes of this lab’s checkoff, we’ll have you add a new user to the Gitolite server, which will be done
by adding a new file in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">keydir/</code> subdirectory that contains the SSH public key of the new Gitolite user.</p>

<p>Navigate to the directory <code class="highlighter-rouge">keydir</code> under the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gitolite-admin</code> folder. Create a new file named <code class="highlighter-rouge">decal-checkoff.pub</code> using the editor of your choice, and paste in this SSH public key:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDcNRJUAALGBkFfjxC3Vf/qBbeCdPeHHXXKIcTLYghhHNKK1Ob5MQObs6dDGRmur+x6SlDCTokTK+xK/xRoHMwZNKFVJC8fneRjztjy3iy2wap5PzaVw36AvuC+j/N2eInWSf6INQnKvea5/kOlKYMajpI0HOsSxwRvFbMtU0wMX2jhyTalsC7qJkkZuWITBeSTG3iFCMCZ1K3RAk7oUF3dbv36ePAu5lDoq+tyxrH9WJLQeCNkZLn/56m6fY1FMdPLJNWgyE+7QtvhJB/hvrdt9/QiRx1hWHFCJNgYagfAw3FwKKL7859JRy4fLKL4OCjvC/F7cfFi29G96whlYVUx test@test
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After the key has been added, you’ll need to add, commit, and push the file to the Gitolite server through Git.
Assuming you are in <code class="highlighter-rouge">keydir/</code>, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">git add decal-checkoff.pub</code> to track the file under Git, <code class="highlighter-rouge">git commit</code> with a message describing the changes made in the commit,
and finally <code class="highlighter-rouge">git push origin</code> to push the changes up to the Gitolite server.</p>

<h4 id="adding-a-new-git-repository">Adding a new Git repository</h4>

<p>Now that you’ve added a new Gitolite user, you’ll need to create a new Git repository that they can access.
In Gitolite, this is done by modifying the <code class="highlighter-rouge">conf/gitolite.conf</code> file within the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gitolite-admin</code> repository.</p>

<p>Edit <code class="highlighter-rouge">gitolite.conf</code> to create a new repository with name <code class="highlighter-rouge">decal-checkoff</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">RW+</code> access given to both <code class="highlighter-rouge">admin</code> (you) and <code class="highlighter-rouge">decal-checkoff</code>.
Hopefully, you can figure out what format Gitolite expects by looking at the entires for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">admin</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">testing</code> repositories.
The only gotcha is that multiple users have to separated by a space and nothing else.</p>

<p>Once you have done that, follow the same Git workflow as with <code class="highlighter-rouge">decal-checkoff.pub</code> to add, commit, and push the changes to <code class="highlighter-rouge">gitolite.conf</code>
to the Gitolite server.</p>

<p>If you’ve done everything correctly, running <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh gitolite3@[username].decal.xcf.sh info</code> should display something like:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>hello admin, this is gitolite3@test running gitolite3 3.6.6-1 (Debian) on git 2.11.0

 R W	decal-checkoff
 R W	gitolite-admin
 R W	testing
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However, please make sure that you have added the <code class="highlighter-rouge">decal-checkoff</code> user and given it permissions for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">decal-checkoff</code> repository,
as we will be using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh info</code> command to check you off for the lab, and the command only works if the <code class="highlighter-rouge">decal-checkoff</code> user has been
added properly.</p>

<h2 id="backups">Backups</h2>

<p>We’ll be briefly practicing using <code class="highlighter-rouge">rsync</code>, a powerful file transfer tool often used in backup scenarios. It is difficult to 
overstate the degree to which <code class="highlighter-rouge">rsync</code> and the rsync delta-transfer algorithm are used in the real world.</p>

<p>On a superficial level, <code class="highlighter-rouge">rsync</code> works similarly to <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/scp"><code class="highlighter-rouge">scp</code></a> - it copies files from <code class="highlighter-rouge">src</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">dst</code>, optionally over the network,
over SSH. What makes <code class="highlighter-rouge">rsync</code> in particular so powerful is its ability to keep two directories synchronized
while transferring little beyond the absolute difference in files between the two directories. It does this by calculating 
the differences between blocks in a file, and only transferring the difference (the ‘delta’). By default, it assumes that a file is unchanged if its last modified time is not newer.
For example, if one line in a 1-GB text file is changed, rsync won’t transfer the entire file again, but will send the one line that changed.</p>

<p>The basic syntax of <code class="highlighter-rouge">rsync</code> is <code class="highlighter-rouge">rsync [options] [[user]@host:]source [[user]@host:]dest</code> - you can either transfer files
in the local filesystem, between the local system and a network host, or between network hosts.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">rsync</code> has dozens of options, but the most common are the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">-r</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">--recursive</code>: recursively transfer all files and subdirectories in the source</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">-v</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">--verbose</code>: verbosely print out file names and transfer speeds</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">-P</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">--partial --progress</code>: keep partially transferred files if the transfer is interrupted, show progress of file transfers</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">-a</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">--archive</code>: combination option, implies <code class="highlighter-rouge">-r</code>, and preservation of most file metadata properties</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">-u</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">--append</code>: append data to the end of files on the destination that are smaller than the corresponding

</ul>

<p>Suppose you keep all your homework in a directory “school”, in your home directory:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>user@machine [~/school] $ ls
cs198-8
cs61a
cs262
some_r1a
ds8
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>and you want to back everything to your student VM. A command like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ rsync -rvPaz ~/school user@user.decal.xcf.sh:school-backup/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>would result in a copy of your <code class="highlighter-rouge">school</code> directory being made inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">school-backup</code> directory on your student VM.</p>

<p>Play around with <code class="highlighter-rouge">rsync</code> yourself. We’ve provided some test files <a href="https://decal.ocf.berkeley.edu/static/b9/rsync-example.tar.gz">here</a>. (hint: use <code class="highlighter-rouge">wget</code>).
After extracting the archive, (<code class="highlighter-rouge">tar xzvf rsync-example.tar.gz</code>), you’ll see two directories with over 100MB of files in them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What happens if you try <code class="highlighter-rouge">rsync</code>ing <code class="highlighter-rouge">dir1</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">dir2</code> using <code class="highlighter-rouge">rsync -racv dir1/ dir2/</code>? (hint: it should finish almost instantaneously). Why might this be the case?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What <code class="highlighter-rouge">rsync</code> commands would you use to keep both directories in sync, from updating the source to dest and dest to source?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What happens if you truncate one of the files in the dest directory (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">dir2</code>, by <code class="highlighter-rouge">truncate --size=5M file2.txt</code>) and then try <code class="highlighter-rouge">rsync</code> from source to dest again?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Now that you know how to set up a Gitolite server and add users and repositories to it, you can now use your VM (before we delete it at the end of the semester)
as a git remote to back up your programming projects, fanfic collections, etc., free from the prying eyes of our Github overlords.</p>

<h2 id="checkoff">Checkoff</h2>

<p>The checkoff form is <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/J0V7kn6yStEu4oZf1">here</a>. Please double-check that you’ve completed the Gitolite section successfully, as we will be running <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh gitolite3@[username].decal.xcf.sh info</code> to
check you off on the Gitolite section. If you’d like to double-check that you added the decal-checkoff user properly, you can add another new user with a different SSH key (maybe from your laptop or an OCF desktop),
and run the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh info</code> command from that machine.</p>
