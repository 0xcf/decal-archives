<h2>getting an OCF account:</h2>
	This course will be taught on the Open Computing Facility's hardware.
	If you don't have an OCF account already, you'll need to sign up for one.

	You should do this on the first day of class, but if you missed this
	chance, you can do it <a href=http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/staff_hours>anytime a staff member is around</a>.
	You can go to <a href=http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/services/newacct.html>this page</a> to get the new account form 
	if you'd rather print it and fill it out at home although we usually 
	have copies in the lab).

<h2>Homework</h2> <UL>
0)  Don't worry if this doesn't make sense yet, we'll cover the basic commands in the
second lecture.

1)  Create a transcript that shows you understand several of the commands listed above.
Several people have asked, "what is a transcript?"  By transcript, I mean a file that 
shows the output of your session.  <a href=lec1ex.txt>See this example.</a>
Yours will be longer.  You can use the <b>script</b> command to create the transcript, 
or you can cut and paste, whatever works for you.

Don't bother demonstrating knowledge of editors, mail readers, or remote access programs, 
we'll get into more details on those later, if possible, and besides, that will make your
transcript look crufty.
Don't print anything.  
Use flags (options, i.e. "-l" is an option for <b>ls</b>, as in <b>ls -l</b>. 
Do demonstrate the use of input/output redirection.

2) Find another source of interesting or useful information, 
such as the sites and books listed below.  
Google.com's search engine could be useful for this. 
Tell us what the source is, and describe the source briefly.

i.e.<UL>
<LI>www.sunfreeware.com - it has software packages for various sun operating systems.
or
<LI>www.slashdot.org - has news and information about computing and technology

Mail your homework, and any questions to jones@xcf.berkeley.edu

<B>There are numerous good books on System Administration in circulation.</B><BR>

<UL>

My favorite general-purpose book is <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130206016/>Unix System Administration
Handbook</a> by Nemeth, Snyder, Seebass and Hein.  Now in it's third edition, this book provides excellent coverage of many
routine system administration tasks.  For deeper understanding of a variety of topics, <a
href=http://www.oreilly.com/>O'Reilly & Associates</a> is my favorite publisher.  Their books are nearly always high quality,
and are usually written by reputable sources, and occasionally by the actual creators of a tool.  For example, the most famous
book on Perl is published by O'Reilly and is called <a href=http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pperl3/>Programming Perl</a> was
written by Larry Wall, the creator of Perl.

<B>System Administration Cultural Resources:</B><BR> 

<UL>

The field of unix system administration really does have it's own culture.  Being very computer-centric, there are countless
newsgroups, email-lists, irc-channels, and websites dedicated to the task and the surrounding culture.  This culture does 
have it's egos and social-ills, but by and large is very supportive and genial.<P>
