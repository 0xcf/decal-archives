<h2>NFS</h2>

To export to other machines, use:
/etc/exports

However, on Solaris, use:
/etc/dfs/dfstab

File usage:
directory machine1 (options) machine2 (options)

Example:
/mp3      192.168.0.5(ro)    192.221.58.0/255.255.255.0(ro,rw)

where ro = Read Only
      rw = Read/Write

- Can be used as comma seperated values to select more that one option.
- Machine2's usage allows access to any machine that begins with
  192.221.58.x

How to mount a shared directory:
mount -t nfs server:/mp3  /server/mp3

filesystem  | mountpoint  | ftype |    options   | dump | pass
server:/mp3   /server/mp3   nfs     ro, defaults    0      0

On Solaris:
share -Fnfs /mp3     // to share
unshare /mp3         // to unshare


<h2>Networking</h2>

<h2>IP Addresses</h2>

24.20.160.210  // Calman's IP address, good place for a DoS attack...

IP Addresses are written at four numbers that range from 0 to 255 and
are broken up into 5 classes:

First Field  Class  8-bit   8-bit  8-bit   8-bit
   0-127       A    Net     Host   Host    Host
 128-191       B    Net     Net    Host    Host
 192-223       C    Net     Net    Net     Host

Special Reserved IP's:
10.0.0.0 / 255.0.0.0        // For class A
127.0.0.1                   // Loopback - always points to your machine
198.168.0.0 / 255.255.255.0 // For class C


<h2>Subnets</h2>

A subnet is a group of machines that have a direct connection to each
other, i.e., they are all on the same switch or router.  In order to
talk to a computer outside of your subnet, you have to go through a
gateway.

Suppose you have a class C IP:
128.32.42.x

128.32.42.0 and 128.32.42.255 are reserved

So you have 256 - 2 or 254 free IPs on your subnet.

How do you tell who is on your subnet?  Use a subnet mask.

For our example, the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 will allow us to access
all machines in our subnet.  The 255.255.255's only alows one value
each, or 128.32.42 and the O allows any value between 0 and 255 to
pass through.
