<h3>
The File System
</h3>

The file system organizes the programs, user data, accounting and configuration
information, etc.
Different flavors of unix have different filesystem layouts, but there are many
commonalities.  As you get more familiar with unix, you'll know the filesystem
instinctively, but in the meantime, this is a brief overview:

<h3>
Software Installation</h3>


<b>the old fashioned way</b>

The basic way to get software is to download it, compile it and configure it.
Before the web, this meant that you heard about a piece of software, probably
from word of mouth or email, or in a usenet newsgroup, and then you downloaded
it via ftp from a repository somewhere after finding it using archie or another
ftp search engine (think google, but only for ftp sites).

Historical interest aside, downloading and configuring software is essentially
the same today.  What's changed is the quality of the most popular software 
has improved tremendously, to the point where it is quite easy to install and 
configure on most popular Unix systems, and the tools available for maintaining
your software library have improved.

For any popular Unix system, you can search the web for the software or type of
software you need, and download the archive using your web browser.  At this point,
you'll have a file named "filename.tar.gz"  This is a file that's been compressed 
using gnuzip (hence the .gz extension) and archived using tar (hence the .tar 
extension).  Without getting into what that means, here's what you'll need to
do in order to extract the file:

<ul>
mkdir filename    (I usually make a subdirectory, in case the archive doesn't)
mv filename.tar.gz filename
cd filename
gunzip filename.tar.gz   (uncompresses the archive, and removes .gz extension)
tar xvf filename.tar     (extracts the archive)
</ul>

At this point you have the contents of the archive available to you.  
You should look for a README or INSTALL file, and follow the directions there
in order to compile and configure the software.  This may be as simple as 
typing:

<ul>
./configure
make
make install
</ul>

or you may have to go into the Makefiles or worse and modify the program
to suit your system.  You may also have to install additional programs
before you can sucessfully compile or run the desired application.


<b>the new way</b>

For the most popular software, you can sidestep the occasionally troublesome 
compilation process by downloading precompiled versions.

Every advanced system has a packaging system to make software installation
and management even easier.  Often package management will keep track of
which version of software you have installed, and will alert you if you
try to install software that depends on having previously installed other
software, and give you the option of first installing the required
software.

On Solaris, it's called pkgadd.  You can get packages from sun, or from www.sunfreeware.com.
(man pkgadd on a Sun system for more info)

Redhat uses it's own <a href=http://www.redhat.com/support/manuals/RHL-7.1-Manual/customization-guide/p6326.html>Redhat Package Manager</a>

Debian uses the popular <a href=http://www.newriders.com/debian/html/noframes/node84.html>Debian Package System</a>

FreeBSD uses the <a href=http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/ports.html>"/ports" collection</a>.


<h3>
Shell Scripts</h3>
shell scripts are simple programs written with the commands that the shell can 
understand, including it's own built in commands (which are listed on a shell's 
manpage) as well as any other programs on the system.

Shell scripts are used to perform simple system operations like starting 
daemons (see below), and performing accounting.  In recent years, scripting 
languages such as perl have risen to prominence because of their usefulness 
in writing programs for the web.

Most shell scripts used by the system are written in <b>sh</b>'s scripting language
(but that doesn't stop people from writing scripts in csh, bash, ksh or any other 
shell's language).

We'll talk more about shell scripting next week, for now, just take a look at what
a shell script looks like.

One thing to note is that the first line in the file is "magic" -it tells
the system to interpret the file with the program specified after the #!
in the first line.  Because the system must first execute the file, and then 
read the file in as input to the shell, the user trying to run the script 
must have read and execute permissions on the script.

Example:  /etc/rc2.d/S99audit
<ul>

#!/sbin/sh
#
# Copyright (c) 1997 by Sun Microsystems, Inc.
# All rights reserved.
#
#ident  "@(#)audit     1.5      97/12/08 SMI"

case "$1" in
'start')
        if [ -f /etc/security/audit_startup ]; then
                echo 'starting audit daemon'
                /etc/security/audit_startup
                /usr/sbin/auditd &
        fi
        ;;
 
'stop')
        if [ -f /etc/security/audit_startup ]; then
                /usr/sbin/audit -T
        fi
        ;;

*)
        echo "Usage: $0 { start | stop }"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac
exit 0


</ul>

<h3>
startup/shutdown, runlevels</h3>

What happens when you start or shutdown a unix system?  It varies by OS, 
but usually you can find folders or files in /etc/rc* which contain shell
scripts.

There are scripts that the computer runs every time it is started up, which do 
things like set the name of the computer, check disks for corruption, mount 
filesystems, turn on quotas, and do sundry other things depending on what you 
want, or what 'runlevel' you specify.

What's a <b>runlevel</b>?  A runlevel is a shorthand way to tell the system
to get into a certain state of configuration with respects to what services
are running (daemons, see below), whether to allow remote logins, what
filesystems are mounted read-only or read-write, etc.

There are several standard runlevels:
0 or 6 - shut down the system
1 or S - single user mode (no remote logins)
2      - multiuser mode
3      - multiuser with networking 
5      - Graphical User Interfaces enabled
6      - shut down the system

You can change runlevels by using the <b>telinit</b> command.  The behavior
of telinit is dictated by the /etc/inittab configuration file, On Solaris
and Linux systems (at least), the inittab tells the system to run a script
which performs maintenance for changing runlevels, and starts and stops the
appropriate services for that runlevel.  The configuration files for which
services should be run at which level are stored in directories such as
/etc/rc2.d /etc/rc3.d... etc.  These directories contain symlinks to scripts
in /etc/init.d.  The symlinks have names starting with K or S depending on
whether they should be Started or Killed at that particular runlevel.  If
this sounds like a nightmare of complexity, don't worry, it's actually
pretty simple, if not straightforward.

<h3>
daemons</h3>

A daemon is a process that stays running on a system at all times in order
to provide a service on that system.  Daemons do many interesting things on
your system- allow remote access via ssh, telnet and ftp, serve webpages,
deliver email, sync the time to other machines, execute previously 
scheduled tasks...  

Daemon programs are commonly run as root or as their own user, and their 
command names are usually postfixed with a d, for instance, <b>sshd, 
telnetd, ftpd,</b> and <b>httpd</b> (the webserver).

As an aside, you're probably wondering why the name "daemons" rather than
"system process," "background process," or some other more tame name.  Aside 
from the tradition of interesting names in Unix, you may be surprised to 
know that the word "daemon" is not synonymous with "demon." The preferred 
definition in this case is, "a tutelary spirit or internal voice," meaning a 
guiding spirit which is neither good nor evil.

Daemons are usually started by the rc files, as described above, and run as 
background processes for the duration the computer is up.  They usually have 
a configuration file, either in their own directory, or in the /etc/ 
hierarchy.  Let's look at the inetd daemon as an example.

<b>inetd</b> - the Internet Services Daemon From the inetd manpage: "listens
for connections on certain internet sockets.  When a connection is found on
one of its sockets, it decides what service the socket corresponds to, and
invokes a program to service the request...  Essentially, inetd allows
running one daemon to invoke several others, reducing load on the system."
The inet daemon knows which program to invoke according to its configuration 
file, /etc/inetd.conf.  On AT&T systems, inet is started at the 2nd 
runlevel, the runlevel that supports multiuser access and networking.  On 
the OCF, you can see it's startup script linked to from /etc/rc2.d/S69inet.
And it is stopped in the the other runlevel directories:
/etc/rc0.d/K42inetsvc
/etc/rc0.d/K43inet
/etc/rc1.d/K42inetsvc
/etc/rc1.d/K43inet
/etc/rc2.d/S69inet
/etc/rcS.d/K43inet


Another example: <b>init</b>
There is a special daemon called <b>init</b>.  It is the first real program
that is run in the process table, and always has a process ID of 1.  It is
responsible for maintaining accounting information about users logging in,
it is also responsible for restarting other crucial daemons if they die so
that the system stays functional, and it also handles the system shutdown
process.  The folks who wrote init claim that, "The role of init is so
critical that if it dies, the system will reboot itself automatically."
If you kill init (see process control in a later lecture, and read the init 
manpage) the system will be caused to reboot.

<h3>
cron jobs</h3>
<UL>

The <B>cron</B> daemon is a process that executes prescheduled tasks on an
automated basis.

cron is typically used to run automated backups, do system accounting, clean up
temporary files, distribut data to remote computers, remind people about
important dates, and anything that needs to be done on a routine basis.

There are several different versions of cron, and unfortunately the OCF
doesn't allow general-user access to cron.  Access to cron is controlled
with the <b>/etc/cron.d/cron.allow</B> and <b>/etc/cron.d/cron.deny</b>
files.

A brief introduction nonetheless:

on AT&T style systems, a user submits a file (called a crontab) by:
<b>crontab</b> <i>mycrontab</i> 

if the user already has a crontab, she can retrieve it with:
<b>crontab -l > mycrontab</b>

The crontab file contains entries in the following format:

			minute hour  day   month  weekday <i>command</i>
with the ranges:	0-59   0-23  1-31  1-12   1-7

the command is a command or script recognizable by <b>sh</b>.

Examples (from the crontab manpage): Mail a birthday greeting:
(at noon, on Feb. 14th)

     0 12 14 2 * mailx john%Happy Birthday!%Time for lunch.


     0 0 * * 1 command
     (would run a command only on Mondays.)


</UL>


</ul>	

<h2>Homework for Lec 7</h2>
<UL>

Create a very small shell script (your file should be two or three lines 
long).  What are the appropriate permissions?  What happens if the 
permissions are wrong?  Turn in the script and the answers to those two 
questions.

Log into an ocf system and find out which daemons are running using <b>ps</b>.
(be sure to specify which system you used, if in doubt use <b>hostname</b> to
find out).  

What would be the appropriate cron entry for a process to be run every 
fifteen minutes?

mail the answers to those questions to jones@xcf.berkeley.edu
</ul>

<h2>enrichment</h2>

Check out the manpages for cron, crontab, init, telinit, inetd, inetd.conf.

Look at the /etc/rc2.d/README and read some of the scripts in
the /etc/rc folders to get a feeling for <b>sh</b>-style shell 
scripting.

On different systems you may have access to, check out which daemons
are running using the <b>ps</b> command.
