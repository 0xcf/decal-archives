<h3>User Accounts</h3>

Before anyone can use your system they must have an account.  If you have joined
the sadistic growing masses who have taken the (life)time to install your first
Linux/UNIX os on a box of your own, then you know that the first user, the one 
we all wish we could be [virtually]everywhere, is root.  Initially, setting up 
a box, configuring it for a network, and initiating it for use, are some things 
that one might do rather harmlessly as that uber-user.  However, the whole 
point is usually to have a box that has multiple users with variegated 
priveleges, logging in and in many cases sharing files that they are granted 
the "permissions" to use.  These permissions are prescribed in a few different
ways and we'll get to that later.  Just keep it in mind as we go through the 
user creation concept and process.

As *respectable* Systems Administrators, we must be aware of the following:

   -be familiar with the configuration files that UNIX uses to store 
    information about accounts:
    /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group, /etc/skel
   -the process involved in creating and removing i.e. reaping user accounts
   -know what information you must have to create an account
   -understand the significance of choosing particular usernames, 
    user ids, and passwords
   -be aware of special accounts including the root account and the 
    implications of transforming yourself into root--you can do good or evil
   -sudo is your friend
   -the number of widely used tools that aid in account management: 
    useradd, usermod, userdel
   -considering an Acceptable Use Policy

========================

The /etc/passwd file is simply a list of all users recognized by the system.

7 Fields in the form of:
login:password:UID:default GID:GECOS information:homedir:login shell

e.g.:
xanatos:*:4021:14:David Xanatos,Illuminati,,:/home/avalon:/bin/sh
-or-
milo:yPf3M5qMgglUc:101:10:Milo Aukerman:/home/allroy/milo:/usr/bin/csh
-or-, when using shadow passwords
squid:x:23:23::/var/spool/squid:/dev/null
-or
shinae:x:1170:810:Shin Ae Tassia:/u9/shinae:/bin/bash
_______________________

Anatomy of the file, /etc/passwd:

 login: login names, aka usernames, are alphanumeric, 8 characters long, and unique.
Red Hat and other Linux distributions allow for longer login names though to insure
that one can use the same login on all boxes no matter what the OS, it is just 
practical to limit it to 8 charaters.  They are case sensitive and best kept all 
lowercase, especially since sendmail and other mailers expect lowercase logins.

 encrypted password: 13 characters, of which the random first 2 are the salt; an 
empty field means that *no* password is required to access the account

 -or- placeholder "x" when using shadow passwords: mandatory under solaris, this 
file is readable only by root, contains encrypted passwords, and is autonomous 
from /etc/passwd 

 UID: unique 32-bit Integer user identifier, (root has a UID 0) usually the UID's
between 0-100 are reserved for non-human users such as daemon, and for the sake of
preserving the interoperability between systems, the purple book suggests not 
maxing out your UID's at Linux'x 65,535 when most systems have a limit of 32,767
like Solaris--and don't recycle a UID being that if a file brought back from the 
dead, it will have the UID of the original user and if they were reaped long ago, 
and another user now has that UID, the latter now owns those file regardless of the
login name being different...just do it 'cuz the purple book said so 

 default GID: similar to UID, it is a 16 or 32-bit integer where GID 0 is for group
root or, wheel (on a DECsystem-20 mainframe running TOPS-20, it was the wheel-bit 
that gave users omnipotence)--groups are defined in /etc/group and users can be and
usually are in more than one group at a time up to about 16

 GECOS information: personal user information that finger can expand to the login
If you need to know like I do: General Electric Comprehensive Operating System, and
the field in /etc/passwd is all that remains

e.g.: 
research:~> finger devin
Login name: jones                     In real life: Devin Jones
Directory: /u9/jones                  Shell: /bin/bash
Last login Wed Mar 14 02:30 on pts/11 from hosers.net
Mail last read Mon Mar 12 04:41:41 2001
No Plan.

 home directory: specifies the location of the user's home within the os and is 
placed here by the login program
 
 login shell: it's a command interpreter such as: sh (Bourne shell), csh (C shell),
tcsh (Extended C shell), bash (GNU Bourne-Again SHell), or ksh (David Korn's shell),
or any program that is executed at login 

========================

The /etc/group file contains group names, their corresponding GID's, and the usernames
of each group's members

4 Fields in the form of:
group-name:password:GID:comma-separated,list,of,names

e.g.:
sysadmin:*:14:shinae,fil,annino
-or-
god::15:shinae,jones

========================

The /etc/shadow file is a file only root can read that contains the encrypted
passwords that would otherwise be in the world readable /etc/passwd

9 Fields in the form of:
login:password:lastchg:min:max:warn:inactive:expire:flag

e.g.:
barbie:OlNcTJJjGhUJ2:9083:0:::90::
-or-
ken:NJ2Wu.dJWLYTo::::::11474:

_______________________

Anatomy of the file, /etc/shadow:

 login: username

 password: 13 character encrypted password

 lastchg: number of days from Jan 1, 1970 to the last password change

 min: minimum number of days required between password changes

 max: maximum number of days the password is valid

 warn: number of days before expiring the password that the user is warned

 inactive: number of days of inactivity allowed for the user

 expire: absolute date after which the login may no longer be used

 flag: unused

========================

To rehash:

Anatomy of a UNIX account:

 login (or user) name: see above

 password: see above

 numeric user identifier or UID: see above

 GID, a default numeric group identifier: see above
 N.B. accounts can and usually do belong to more than one group 
 but all accounts have one default group

 home directory: see above

 login shell: see above

 startup files, or dot (.) files: filenames that start with a dot [.] that are
usually placed in the user's home directory that dictate how certain commands
such as bash (.bashrc) behave when they are first executed

 ~/.forward or mail alias (maybe)

 mail file

If you wanted to create a user's account by hand, you would have to:
1. pick a unique username and UID (must not conflict with another user, 
	or any existing mail alias)
2. create a homedirectory for them, and give them appropriate dotfiles
3. add the entry to the passwd file
4. run "passwd user" for that user and give them a password
(their mail file will be created automatically by your mail program)

Which is why there are scripts such as "adduser" and "useradd" on most systems.

<h3>File Permissions</h3>

Examine your home directory with the command, "ls -l"
ex:

% ls -l
total 20
drwxr-xr-x   4 bac      ocf          512 Mar  7 13:45 Blackbox/
drwx------   2 bac      ocf          512 Mar 19 00:24 Mail/
drwx------   2 bac      ocf          512 Sep 30 18:39 mail/
drwxr-xr-x   3 bac      ocf          512 Feb 28 13:33 ns_imap/
drwx------   2 bac      ocf          512 Oct 25 15:28 nsmail/
drwxr-xr-x   3 bac      ocf          512 Nov 16 18:42 office52/
lrwxrwxrwx   1 bac      www           26 Oct 22 13:20 public_html -> /services/http/users/b/bac/
drwxr-xr-x   2 bac      ocf          512 Mar 18 15:12 Python/
-rw-r--r--   1 bac      ocf          644 Feb  4 16:17 README.x
-rw-r--r--   1 bac      ocf          573 May  7  2000 StarOffice52

You've probably seen this kind of output before, did you ever wonder 
what that information on the left is?  "drwxr-xr-w"?  This information
tells us who has permission to read, write or execute this file.

It can be divided into four groups:  drwxrwxrwx -> d rwx rwx rwx
				or:  l--s--s--s    _ ___ ___ ___
What do they mean?				   |  |	  |   |
		  1 	directory or symlink?... _/   |	  |   |
		  2	owner's permissions........../    |   |
		  3	group permissions................/    |
                  4     everyone else's permissions........../


Going left to right:
1.  If the filename refers to a directory, or a symlink, this will be 
	"d" or "l" respectively.  A symlink is a file that points to 
	another file, just like a shortcut in Microsoft Windows.  It
	it can point to a file or a directory.

2.  The owner's permissions:  the owner of the file is listed in the 3rd
       column (in this case, "bac"):
 
	       \
		|
		v
drwx------   2 bac      ocf          512 Mar 19 00:24 Mail/
			 ^
			 |
			/
3.  The group permissions:  the group is listed in the 4th column (here "ocf").

4.  Everyone else's permissions.

In each of these cases, rwx stands for "read," "write," and "execute"
specifically:
read = enables the file to be read, important for text files and scripts, 
	but not for programs.
write = allows writing to, or deleting of files.
execute = allows a program file to be executed, asuming it can be evaluated as
	an executable binary file or a parsable script  (scripts also need to
	be read-enabled, because the file is "read" as it is interpreted).

	<B>Note:</b>  for directories, the executable bit indicates that files inside
	the directory can be accessed and read (if their permissions permit),
	even if the directory cannot be "read" (which would mean that you will 
	not be able to get a file listing, but you will be able to access files
	if you know their names).


Here are some examples:

For the following file: 
	-rw-r--r--   1 bac      ocf          644 Feb  4 16:17 README.x
	Anyone can read this file, but only the owner can write to it.

For the following directory:
	drwx------   2 bac      ocf          512 Oct 25 15:28 nsmail/
	Only the owner can read or write files in this directory.

<B>How do you affect the permission bits?</B>

The <b>chmod</b> utility:

By this point, you've looked at baffeling and useless man pages before, but the
<b>chmod</b> manpage is actually useful and comprehensible, you should check it
out.

To summarize, chmod has two ways of changing file permission bits, the 
easy-to-remember way, and the fast way.

<h3>The easy to remember way</h3>

The easy to remember way involves abbreviations.  The first rwx triad is called the 
user triad, abbreviated "u," the second and third are "g"roup and "o"ther.

To add a permission to the user triad for a file:
chmod u+x filename
(allow the user to execute filename)

You can add more than one type of permission at a time:
chmod u+rwx filename
(allow the user to read, write and execute filename)

You can also reference more than one group at a time:
chmod ug+rx filename
(allow user and group to read and execute filename)
	Note that if this is the same file that we just gave user rwx permissions,
	the user will still have rwx.  <i>Adding</i> rx doesn't imply <i>removing</i> w.
	
To remove permissions from a file:
chmod o-wx filename
(disallow others (users not either the owner or a member of the file's group) from
writing/deleting or executing the file)

To exactly set the permissions bits, regardless of their current status:
chmod u=rwx,go=r filename

<h3>The fast way</h3>

The fast way involves thinking of each triad as an octal number.  Since each triad 
is made up of three bits, the three triads can be expressed as three octal numbers:

where the alphabetic version is binary, where a letter represents a 1, and a dash a 
zero:

binary		octal
------		-------
rwx = 111	7
r-x = 101	5
r-- = 100	4

In this manner, each permission has it's own octal value:

permission	octal
----------	-----
read    (r--)	4
write   (-w-)	2	
execute (--x)	1

And combined permissions are expressed by summing the octal values of each 
permission, as seen above.

Each triad then has it's own octal value, and you can completely determine the 
permissions for a file in one small command:

chmod 755 filename
(give the file's owner (aka user) rwx permissions, everyone else rx permissions)
(equivalent to "chmod u=rwx,go=rx")

chmod 644 filename
(give the owner rx, everyone else gets read-only access)

chmod 400 filename
(give the owner read perms, everyone else can't read the file)

<h3>other useful commands</h3>

<b>chown</b> - change the owner of a file:

	# ls -l
	-rw-rw-r--    1 bob      user            2 Oct  3 01:46 filename
	# chown jones filename
	-rw-rw-r--    1 jones    user            2 Oct  3 01:46 filename
	(this command can only be run by root, or else to gain full permissions
	 to a file, you would just have to declare yourself the owner!)

<b>chgrp</b> - change a file's group ownership:

        # ls -l
        -rw-rw-r--    1 jones    user            2 Oct  3 01:46 filename
        # chgrp foobar filename
        -rw-rw-r--    1 jones    foobar          2 Oct  3 01:46 filename
        (this command also can only be run by root)

<h2>The root account</h2>

What is the difference between user accounts and the root account?

Any process run by the root account, or any account with UID 0, has special
privileges, as do any processes started by those processes.  Specifically, 
root has read and write acccess to every file, directory, and device.

It's important to be careful when using the root account.  It's easy to
make simple mistakes that can cause a lot of damage.  

Since the root shell has extra powers, it is conventional for the root
prompt to be "#" rather than the default "%"

<h3>How do you access the root account?</h3>

The root account can be accessed by logging in, like any other account, but this is
seldom a good idea for several reasons.  If you are not sitting in front of your
system's console, and you are accessing you system across the network, you will
have to send your password over the net.  The telnet protocol sends the password
over the net in plain text, meaning anyone listening on any system inbetween where
you are and the system you are logging into will be able to intercept your
password.  An ssh client will encrypt your transmission making it much harder to
intercept, but there are still security concerns.

One way around the problem of sending your system's root password over the
network is to use sudo, from the University of Colorado.  This is a utility
that allows certain specified users to execute commands as root by typing:

% <b>sudo</b> command -flags 

it checks to see if the user is approved to use sudo (in the "sudoers" file), and
then prompts the user for the user's own password (rather than the root passwd).

sudo use can be logged, which provides some degree of accountability if you have 
multiple people acting as root.

Another method is to use "su" which is an older command that will give you a 
root shell after prompting you for the root password.  Su use is also logged,
and on many systems users are required to be explicitly allowed to use "su"
in a configuration file.

<h2>Homework - Due April 4, 2001</h2>
<UL>

Adding users:

On the OCF, we use Sun's NIS to manage passwords for our network.
To look at the real password file, you need to type, "niscat passwd"
rather than "cat /etc/passwd"  

How many users are in the OCF's passwd file?

What is your UID.  What does UID stand for?

File Permissions:

Check out the chmod manpage.  What are "perm" symbols?  What does the 
"who" symbol "a" mean?

What is the equivalent of "chmod 744 filename" using perm symbols?

Check out the chown manpage.  What does the command "chown :jib filename" do?

Check out the sudo manpage.  What happens if a user who is not listed in the 
sudoers file tries to execute sudo?

Class Feedback:
Do you have any questions about the class?  What would you like to learn?
Do you feel that the lectures are going too fast/too slow/just right?
