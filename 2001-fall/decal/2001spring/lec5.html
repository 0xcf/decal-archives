	If you have trouble, please email me, or one of the other teachers.
	The OCF staffers are often around the lab, and can be helpful.
	Don't forget your classmates can also be helpful.  

	<b>Class Project</b>

For the class project for the sysadmin decal class, you will have
the option of installing linux, freebsd or another unix or unixlike OS,
or taking on a project of similar scope  (contact jones@csua to sanity 
check project ideas).

You can work alone or in groups of up to three students.

You will do your project with a member of the ocf staff, on either a
gateway, or on the special installation ppro which is sitting on the
desk by the whiteboard.  That machine is specifically for installing
stuff on.  You may also bring in and use your own hardware for the 
installation.

The level of installation can be as simple or complex as you want,
the point being to be comfortable with the process of doing an
installation.  Of course if you are already comfortable with
installing OSs, then you can do a kernel upgrade or suggest some
other similarly sized project according to your experience, hubris
and desire.

The whole process should be on the order of a few hours, depending on
your skill and the speed of the machine you're using.

As of March 2001, Ken's page has a list of contacts for the gateways.
<a href=http://www.OCF.Berkeley.EDU/~kenao/OCF/apro.shtml>ken's list</a>
The list shows who has installed different operating systems on the 
various machines

What to turn in?  Each groupmember will need to do a 1-2+ page
write-up, and mail it to the OCF staffperson who assisted you.  
That staffer should then forward the writeup to me, confirming that
what you've written up reflects the work you did.

The writeup should summarize what you did, with details on any
problems you ran into and how you worked through them.

<h2>class notes:</h2><ul>

<h3>What free unix operating systems are available?</h3>

<h3>Where can you get install media?</h3>

Most of the time the install media will be cd or possibly two cds for a <br> particular distribution.
These cd's can be made from iso files that can be <br> found online. An iso file is just a large file
with all the content and <br> directories of a cd. When you burn the iso to a cd (varies on your burning
<br> software), it keeps the directory structure intact and will usually also <br> make the cd bootable
(if your machine supports it,though most modern PC do)<br> If you know which distribution of linux or bsd
you want to install you can <br> in most cases goto the homepage of that distribution, www.debian.org,
<br> www.freebsd.org or www.linux-mandrake.com for example. Or if you are unsure<br> of what distribution
you want, or you are having trouble finding the ISOs <br> on the homepage you can visit a site like
www.linuxiso.org and have a wide <br> array of distributions to choose from. All you have to do is find
the right<br> ISO file(s) and download them. Be warned, the iso's are usually the size <br> of an entire
CD (~650 megs), so downloading them over a slow connection can<br> be very tedious.

<h3>What is dual booting?</h3>

Check out the graph in the back of the OCF near the server room 
door that shows the evolution of the different strains of unix.

There are many good web sources for information about different 
versions of unix available today.

there are many linux distributions, the more popular ones as of
