<ol>
  <li>The seventh weekâ€™s labs and lectures have been released! You can view them below.</li>
  <li>Due to minor issues with the participation assignments, we will give everyone who submitted the first 4 assignments full credit, regardless of your score. If youâ€™d like to go back and figure out the correct answers though, weâ€™ve reopened them and you can resubmit them as you like. <br />
We will be going back to the original policy of a score of at least 5/10 being required for participation credit. So, you can either attend live lab to receive the code (worth 5 points), or get all of the lecture questions correct with instant feedback (also worth 5 points).</li>
