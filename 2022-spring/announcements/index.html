<ol>
  <li>The seventh week’s labs and lectures have been released! You can view them below.</li>
  <li>Due to minor issues with the participation assignments, we will give everyone who submitted the first 4 assignments full credit, regardless of your score. If you’d like to go back and figure out the correct answers though, we’ve reopened them and you can resubmit them as you like. <br />
We will be going back to the original policy of a score of at least 5/10 being required for participation credit. So, you can either attend live lab to receive the code (worth 5 points), or get all of the lecture questions correct with instant feedback (also worth 5 points).</li>
