Class cancelled for lack of interest

<p>Intended for students comfortable with the Unix shell; prior system administration experience is helpful, though not required.  Learn about the structure, operation, and maintenance of Unix operating systems.  Emphasis on understanding how it works, not just how to do it.  Topics include the Unix kernel, performance tuning, networking, and system security; we may cover other topics, depending on time and class interest.</p>
