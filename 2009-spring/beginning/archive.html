	<li><span class="date">2009.03.05</span>: If you haven't already, please run the <tt>register</tt> command on your <tt>inst</tt> accounts. It should have already run this when you last SSHed into the EECS servers. If you are using a <tt>named</tt> account, please read and follow the <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/pub.cgi?file=grading.docs/grading.setup.named.accounts">instructions</a>, replacing instances of <tt>coursename</tt> or <tt>classname</tt> with <tt>cs198/cs198-15</tt>. If you have any problems, please email us. To lookup your grades, simply SSH into an EECS server and run <tt>glookup</tt>.</li>
	<li><span class="date">2009.02.09</span>: As stated in class today, it's highly recommended that you learn a command-line text editor of some sort. Some of the more popular ones include <tt>emacs</tt> and <tt>vim</tt>. You can run <tt>vimtutor</tt> on most machines to learn <tt>vim</tt> or look at these reference documents for <tt>emacs</tt>: <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/reader/gnuemacs.pdf">Highlights of GNU Emacs</a> and <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/reader/quick.pdf">Emacs Quick Reference Guide</a> (courtesy of CS61A). Additionally, if you are still lost in the command-line, check out this step-by-step <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/sysadmin-decal/2007-spring/beginning/supp_introduction.pdf">supplementary guide</a>. Finally, <strong>no class next Monday, 2/16</strong></li>
