<h2><a name="announcements"></a>Announcements</h2>

<ul>
	<li><span class="date">2008.12.01</span>: Holy crap, welcome to December!
	Since everyone seems to be doing something web-related for their project,
	HTTP and HTTPS ports for all virtual servers have been opened. If your
	server is <tt>iXY</tt>, your HTTP port is 2XY80 and your HTTPS port is
	2XY43. You must configure Apache properly to use those ports (hint: there
	is a conspicuously named file in /etc/apache2 that you can use to configure
	these things.).</li>
	<li><span class="date">2008.11.17</span>: If you're having trouble coming
	up with a project proposal, check out <a href="sample_proposal.pdf">a
	proposal from last semester</a>. Yours doesn't have to be this detailed,
	but it may help you figure out what you should include in your own
	project proposal. This one is just the role model :)</li>
	<li><span class="date">2008.10.28</span>: <b>Class is cancelled today</b>
	because I'm sick. Your homework is to come up with a project proposal. See
	your email for details. (You should come to class anyway to talk with
	your group about it, at least for a little bit.)</li>
	<li><span class="date">2008.10.21</span>: Solutions have been posted for
	labs 1-3, and more are coming. Also I've added links to some shell
	scripting guides in the Links section.</li>
	<li><span class="date">2008.10.09</span>: I have set up a screen name
	for DeCal questions. If I am online you may ask me anything. The screen
	name is <b>JoshDecal</b>. Also, to clarify for the lab, you may use apt-get
	to install the build-essential package for Lab 4.</li>
	<li><span class="date">2008.10.07</span>: If you still have problems
	accessing man pages for labs, remember that you can always google for
	"(command) man page" and generally you can find an online version.
	Also, please note that <b>all labs up to and including lab 3 are now due
	next Tuesday, the 14th.</b> Finally, I am discontinuing my Friday office
	hour due to poor attendance.</li>
	<li><span class="date">2008.09.24</span>: Here's a
	<a href="fwunixref.pdf">Linux cheat sheet</a> that I think will be helpful
	during the course of this class. Also, I realized the class time was
	wrong on the course info below. It is 5PM as I'm sure most of you have
	figured out.</li>
	<li><span class="date">2008.09.23</span>: I am trial running an extra
	office hour on Friday, same time/place (Brewed Awakening 1-2P.) This is
	because some people can't make the Thursday one. Feel free to come to
	whichever one is more convenient for you, and please come, especially
	if I asked you in an email to! It could become permanent if y'all
	<i>bother to show up.</i> I would especially like it if those who missed
	the first lecture could come, but if you can catch up by yourself, then
	feel free to. I'm willing to invest the time it takes to get everyone
	up to speed.</li>
	<li><span class="date">2008.09.17</span>: Some of you have noticed that
	there is no man page for <tt>wget</tt> on the Soda lab machines. Try
	using SSH (ssh in a Terminal on OS X, or use
	<a href="http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe">PuTTY</a>
	on Windows) to log in with your username and password to
	<tt>ilinux1.eecs.berkeley.edu</tt>.</li>
	<li><span class="date">2008.09.08</span>: The first class will be on
	<b>September 16</b>. Prospective students should be able
	to enroll through <a href="http://telebears.berkeley.edu">Tele-Bears</a>
	using the given CCNs: 26208 (lower), 26207 (upper). The class is two (2)
	units. Any questions regarding the course should be emailed to the
	facilitators or <a
	href="mailto:sysadmin-decal@ocf.berkeley.edu">sysadmin-decal@ocf</a>.</li>

</p>

<p>
Welcome! This <b>intermediate</b> course is targeted towards CS students,
either with some prior Unix experience or an eager ability to learn new things
quickly. The curriculum is somewhat similar to the <a
href="../beginning">beginning class</a>; however, we emphasize a more bottom-up
approach that encourages a good working knowledge and understanding of Unixes
before starting any system administration tasks.  In fact, we spend very little
time on what is considered stereotypical systems administration: the task of
maintaining a web server with a database.  <i>That's just the tip of the
iceberg.</i> Any sysadmin worth their salt will tell you that there are far
more things you need to be good at!  See above for all the planned lecture
topics.</p>

		<p>The course is given in a lecture-lab format. After discussing the
		material for a given week, we will follow with 45 minutes to 1 hour
		of lab time. Many people will be able to complete the labs within
		this time, and most people will at least be able to complete at
		least half. So if you play your cards right, the weekly out-of-class
		commitment is less than an hour.</p>

		<p>Astute readers have already noticed that there is a <b>final
		project</b>. This project requires you to collaborate with groups of
		3-4 other people to develop some sort of system that shows that you
		know how to integrate many disparate open source components together
		into a coherent unit. However, you needn't be too ambitious. The
		project as a whole should take about 10-15 man-hours, which is up
		to 4 hours per person, all things being equal.</p>

<h2><a name="moreinfo"></a>Menacing Stuff We Need to Say</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Attendance is mandatory. More than <b>four</b> unexcused absences will
	result in a NP. Please <a href="mailto:joshk.decal@triplehelix.org">email
	me</a> if you have extenuating circumstances (midterm, final, etc.)</li>
	<li>There will be weekly homework assignments, graded on a P/NP basis. There is no strict due date for each one, but you are expected to keep up and be done with all of them by the end of the term.</li>
	<li>A final project will be given in lieu of an exam; <strong>failure to
	complete will result in a NP</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="extra"></a>Extra Links</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="fwunixref.pdf">Linux Cheat Sheet from FOSSwire.com</a>:
	contains a bunch of useful commands all on one page that will surely be
	helpful.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.freeos.com/guides/lsst/">Linux Shell Scripting
	Tutorial</a>: a guide to shell scripting that may be a useful alternative
	to looking at the shell-scripting slides.</li>
	<li><a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/">Advanced Bash Scripting Guide</a>:
	This guide is a little more in-depth -- read it if you want to go above and
	beyond what we learned in class.</li>
