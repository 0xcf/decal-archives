I. Playing with Users and Groups

1. a) finger joshk - shows user information for joshk and when he was last
      seen on the computer you're logged into.
   b) w - shows a list of everyone logged on right now with detailed info.
   c) who - just shows the list of everyone logged on; very similar to w,
      just more terse.
   d) last - shows the history of logins to this computer.
   e) id - shows who you are, what your user ID is, and what groups you
      belong to.

2. By default, finger foo will search for foo in everyone's real name as
   well. This takes a long time. If you know the username of the person
   you're trying to look up, use finger -m foo.

3. uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

II. File System Permissions

The only thing you can do succesfully is to rm file2. Everything else is
permission denied.

III.

1. Answer omitted.

2. a) Your Mileage May Vary - I've given you a solution but it may or may
      not work for you
   b) There's More Than One Way To Do It - The official Perl slogan.
   c) There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch - You must do some additional
      work to accomplish your goal; you can't have your cake and eat it too
   d) Problem Exists Between Chair and Keyboard - *you* are the problem,
      i.e. a mistake was yours alone.
   e) I Am Not A Lawyer - often seen in front of sentences expressing legal
      opinion on mailing lists.
   f) She Who Must Be Obeyed - programmer's wife.
   g) Luser Attitude Readjustment Tool - the thing you use to clobber
      insolent newbies who give you a lot of hassle just when you're trying
      to help.
