<title>Lab 9 - Configuration Management with Puppet (Advanced) - Hands-On UNIX System Administration DeCal</title>

  <h1>Lab 9 - Configuration Management with Puppet (Advanced)</h1>
  <h2 id="the-setting">The Setting</h2>
<p>You’re suddenly awoken by an alarm. Still drowsy from sleep, you check the time on your phone. <em>7:00am??</em> you think to
yourself. <em>No way. I don’t even have any 8ams. In fact, I haven’t woken up this early since…</em> Looking back at your
phone again, which you realize is now 2 times thicker and suddenly has a 3.5mm audio port, you check the year. You may
have thought Berkeley was hell, but now you’ve traveled back in time for some true suffering: high school.</p>

<p>After getting dressed and lamenting your disastrous teenage fashion sense, you get a text message on your dumb phone.
Sighing, you open it even though it’s going to cost you 10 cents.</p>

<p>Rubbing your eyes, you try to understand 5cr1p7k1dd1337’s arcane runes once again:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Welcome back to high school. I have a task for you: you must install the
following script on every computer in your school by the end of today, or
you'll be stuck forever.

Your school uses puppet, so you can just write a module for this. Files are in
the decal-labs repo (https://github.com/0xcf/decal-labs) in the a9/ directory.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>Great</em>, you think to yourself, <em>good thing I’m currently taking the best DeCal at UC Berkeley, the Unix SysAdmin
DeCal! This is gonna be a piece of cake</em></p>

<h2 id="your-task-in-plain-english">Your task, in plain English</h2>

<p>You need to write a puppet module that places a script <code class="highlighter-rouge">hack_everything</code> into <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/local/bin/</code> and sets up a cronjob
to run the script repeatedly and append its output to a file. Your module will need to install the dependencies for the
script and ensure that all of the pieces are installed correctly.</p>

<p>There are three main parts that you’ll need to work on:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Installing the packages the script depends on</li>
  <li>Placing the script in the right directory and placing a file the script depends on in the right directory</li>
  <li>Setting up a cronjob to run the script every 30 minutes and append its output to a file</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ve provided skeleton code for you in the <a href="https://github.com/0xcf/decal-labs"><code class="highlighter-rouge">decal-labs</code> repository</a> If you
haven’t cloned this repo yet, then <code class="highlighter-rouge">git clone https://github.com/0xcf/decal-labs</code> should get you the files.
Otherwise, a simple <code class="highlighter-rouge">git pull</code> from the root of the repository should fetch the files for you. The script is located in
<code class="highlighter-rouge">a9/modules/hacked/files/hack_everything</code></p>

<p>The only file you will need to change is in <code class="highlighter-rouge">a9/modules/hacked/manifests/hacked.pp</code>. We’ve included some hints and
pointers to relevant documentation that will help you complete this manifest.</p>

<p>Although we are only applying your manifest on one machine (your DeCal VM), you could in theory apply this module on
thousands of machines that are connected to a puppet-master! How neat is that!</p>

<p>While you’re writing your manifest, there’s an easy way to check your syntax: you can use the command
<code class="highlighter-rouge">puppet parser validate hacking.pp</code></p>

<p>Once you have completed your manifest, you can apply the changes to your system with this command (I assume you cloned
things into $HOME):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo puppet apply --modulepath=$HOME/decal-labs/a9/modules $HOME/decal-labs/a9/manifests/default.pp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Basically, we’re running puppet locally on the module we just created. <code class="highlighter-rouge">default.pp</code> is just a file that includes the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">hacked</code> module you’re editing, and we need to be sure to include the path to the modules so puppet can find them.</p>

<p>Once this is done, you should be able to run the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">hack_everything</code> (as the script is now in your path). Try it
out!</p>

<p>Hints (if you need them):</p>
<ul>
  <li>The skeleton code has links to relevant docs</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/ocf/puppet/blob/8bcd62077de1c2ff499805f768026213de0c0dbc/modules/ocf_desktop/manifests/suspend.pp">Here is an example puppet manifest that might be helpful</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After you think everything works, fill out the Google form (you’ll need to copy paste your <code class="highlighter-rouge">hacking.pp</code> manifest)
