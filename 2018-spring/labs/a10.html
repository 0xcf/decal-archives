<title>Lab 10 - Special Topics - Hands-On UNIX System Administration DeCal</title>

<article class="markdown-body">
  <h1>Lab 10 - Special Topics</h1>
  <h2 id="docker">Docker</h2>
<p>This exercise is designed to give you some hands-on experience with Docker!
By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create and use a Docker container interactively</li>
  <li>Create a Dockerfile, which allows you to declaratively define your containers</li>
  <li>Run detached containers and understand port forwarding</li>
  <li>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code> to run a multi-container web application</li>
</ul>

<p>Just a forewarning: this lab holds your hand until the last section. Not that the last part is super hard, but it’ll
have a lot less instruction than previous portions which are designed to gently introduce you to Docker.</p>

<p><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/BJ5f7OQyCdjCfIzm1">Here is a link to the Google form</a></p>

<h3 id="installing-docker">Installing Docker</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, Docker isn’t in the official Debian <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt</code> repository. This means there are two methods we can use to
install it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add the official Docker repository to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/apt/sources.list</code>. This allows us to update the version of Docker we
have on our machines with a simple <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt update</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt upgrade</code></li>
  <li>Download the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.deb</code> manually and just install it. If we want to upgrade Docker after we do this, we’ll have to do it
manually as well.</li>
</ol>

<p>You’re welcome to use either method to install Docker. For the first method, refer to the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/#install-docker-ce">Docker website for
instructions</a>. For the second method, here
is a link to a recent <code class="highlighter-rouge">.deb</code> you can use:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/dists/stretch/pool/stable/amd64/docker-ce_18.03.0~ce-0~debian_amd64.deb</code>. At
this point in the course, I trust you can figure out how to install it just given that link 🙂 <em>hint: use <code class="highlighter-rouge">wget</code> and<code class="highlighter-rouge">dpkg</code></em></p>

<p>After installing, I recommend running the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo usermod -aG docker $USER</code> so
you can use Docker as a non-root user. This means you won’t have to type <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo docker</code> all the time. This is optional
but for the rest of this exercise I’m going to assume that you did this. If you see some output like</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sent invalidate(passwd) request, exiting
sent invalidate(group) request, exiting
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is normal, it’s just adding a user to a group.</p>

<h3 id="creating-your-first-docker-container">Creating your first Docker container</h3>
<p>To verify that you installed things correctly, try running</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker run hello-world</code></p>

<p>You should see some friendly output like so (hashes are probably different, don’t worry about it):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
b04784fba78d: Already exists
Digest: sha256:f3b3b28a45160805bb16542c9531888519430e9e6d6ffc09d72261b0d26ff74f
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

<p>Some <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#a-brief-explanation-of-containers">quick definitions from Docker’s website:</a></p>

<p>An <strong>image</strong> is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of
software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files. Images are useful primarily for their
speed, but images can also be used as a base to be built on top of in future images, as you’ll see later with Dockerfiles. In the
last example hello-world was the image used to test our docker installation.</p>

<p>A <strong>container</strong> is a runtime instance of an image—what the image becomes in memory when actually executed.
It runs completely isolated from the host environment by default, only accessing host files and ports if configured to
do so. A container gets created upon executing docker run on an image.</p>

<p>This is similar to the distinction between objects and classes in Object Oriented Programming. Images would be classes,
and containers would be objects.</p>

<p>Be sure to read through the output from running the hello-world image to get an understanding of what the Docker daemon
was doing.</p>

<h3 id="running-an-interactive-container">Running an interactive container</h3>
<p>We’re now going to walk you through running a container interactively. This is useful if you ever need to play around
and install stuff on a bare system without messing up your current system. Try running the following command:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker run -it ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash</code></p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">-i</code> flag tells docker to keep <code class="highlighter-rouge">STDIN</code> open to your container, and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-t</code> flag allocates a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoterminal">pseudo-TTY</a> for you. Basically you need both for you to have a way to
enter text and have this display properly. At the end of the command, <code class="highlighter-rouge">/bin/bash</code> is just the command you want to run
once the container starts up. Try installing some packages from <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt</code> or just play around. It should look like a bare
Linux system.</p>

<p>You can exit the container with <code class="highlighter-rouge">CTRL+D</code>.</p>

<p>Notice how even though your VM is running Debian, you were able to run the Xenial version of Ubuntu in a container. If
you are curious about other variants of Linux, you can run a lot of them inside containers as well! This all works because
Linux distributions all share the Linux kernel. For that same reason, you won’t be able to run MacOS or Windows in a container.
You can try running <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a> (<em>*tips hat*</em> M’Linux), another long-running Linux distribution:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker run -it fedora:latest /bin/bash</code></p>

<h4 id="questions-answer-on-google-form">Questions (answer on Google form)</h4>

<ol>
  <li>What user are you logged in as by default?</li>
  <li>If you start and then exit an interactive container, and then use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker run -it ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash</code>
command again, is it the same container? How can you tell?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="basic-management">Basic Management</h3>
<p>The Docker CLI (Command Line Interface) has some basic commands for you to monitor running and stopped containers,
downloaded images, and other information. We’ll go over the basic commands you’ll probably use, but be sure to check
out <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/">the full reference</a> if you’re interested.</p>

<p>Firstly, you might want to see the running containers on a system. Use the following command:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker ps</code></p>

<p>Since you (likely) have no containers running, you probably won’t see anything interesting. However, if you pass in the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">-a</code> flag, you’ll also be able to see containers that have stopped (make your terminal wider or it’ll display weird):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>baisang@rapture ~/d/labs&gt; docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                            PORTS               NAMES
35c048c03588        fedora:latest       "/bin/bash"              7 minutes ago       Exited (130) About a minute ago                       mystifying_edison
dd8f7cc2e0cd        fedora:latest       "/bin/bash"              10 minutes ago      Exited (1) 8 minutes ago                              romantic_mahavira
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This lets you see a lot of useful information about the container. Observe that each container has a unique container
id and a unique human-readable name. To get more information about a container, you can use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker logs</code> command
to fetch the logs of a container (whether it’s still running or exited):</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker logs &lt;container_id_or_name&gt;</code></p>

<p>This basically just gives you <code class="highlighter-rouge">stdout</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">stderr</code> for process(es) running in the container.</p>

<p>At some point, you may want to cleanup containers that have exited and you don’t plan on using anymore:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker rm &lt;container_id_or_name&gt;</code></p>

<p>will remove the container.</p>

<p>You may have noticed when you were running the Ubuntu or Fedora containers the first time that Docker downloaded a good
chunk of data before running the image. This is the image of the container. You can view all of the images you’ve
downloaded with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker images</code> command:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>baisang@rapture ~/d/labs&gt; docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
fedora              latest              9110ae7f579f        2 weeks ago         235MB
ubuntu              xenial              f975c5035748        3 weeks ago         112MB
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Images can take up quite a bit of space on your machine, so you may want to clean up images that you don’t plan on
using. This is especially relevant if you get errors about not having enough disk space on your machine:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker rmi &lt;image_id&gt;</code></p>

<p>The image files, as well as various filesystems of containers, are stored in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/lib/docker</code></p>

<p>We’ll go over more commands later on in the lab.</p>

<h3 id="dockerfiles">Dockerfiles</h3>
<p>A more powerful way to interface with Docker is by using a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile allows you to define an image by
specifying all of the commands you would type manually to create an image. Docker can then build images from a specified
Dockerfile. These Dockerfiles can be put into version control and the images distributed as a binary to keep track of
both how the image is constructed and also to keep pre-built images around.</p>

<p>Dockerfiles are very powerful and have many different commands and features. We’ll go over a basic example, but you
should check out the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/">reference page</a> if you are trying to do anything more
complex.</p>

<p>Here is an example Dockerfile that will build an image that has <code class="highlighter-rouge">python3.6</code> installed.
It will also run <code class="highlighter-rouge">python3.6</code> directly, so you’ll be at a python prompt instead of a bash prompt when you run it.</p>

<div class="language-dockerfile highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="s"> ubuntu:bionic</span>

<span class="k">RUN </span>apt-get update <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> apt-get install <span class="nt">-y</span> python3.6 <span class="nt">--no-install-recommends</span>

<span class="k">CMD</span><span class="s"> ["/usr/bin/python3.6", "-i"]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: there are some “best practices” for writing Dockerfiles that the above example doesn’t use,
because it’s a basic example. For instance, we probably would want to delete <code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/lib/apt/lists/*</code>, where <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt</code>
stores the package list information from <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt update</code>, after we are done installing packages. We may also choose to use
Linux variants that are smaller and lighter, e.g. Alpine Linux. The general philosophy is
containers should be kept as small and “light” as possible. If you’re interested in this stuff, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/">check out this
article</a>.</p>

<p>What is this doing? We specify a base image <code class="highlighter-rouge">ubuntu:bionic</code> (release 18.04 of ubuntu, soon to be the latest LTS as of writing).
We then specify that we should run (<code class="highlighter-rouge">RUN</code>) the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt-get update</code> and then <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt-get install python3.6</code> so we can
install <code class="highlighter-rouge">python3.6</code> (note that this package probably isn’t in <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt</code> on your own VMs, which are running an older Debian stable!)
Then we set the default command (<code class="highlighter-rouge">CMD</code>) of the container to run the <code class="highlighter-rouge">python3.6</code> interpreter in interactive mode.</p>

<p>Copy the contents of the Dockerfile above into a file named <code class="highlighter-rouge">Dockerfile</code>.
Then use Docker to build it with the following command:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker build -t mypython:latest .</code></p>

<p>This tells Docker to look in the current directory for a Dockerfile to build, and build it.
The <code class="highlighter-rouge">-t</code> flag tells it to tag this build with the name <code class="highlighter-rouge">mypython:latest</code>.
Docker will look for a Dockerfile in the current directory since you specified <code class="highlighter-rouge">.</code></p>

<p>Remember, you can see all of the images you’ve built on your machine with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker images</code> command.</p>

<h4 id="questions">Questions</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Run the image you just built. Since we specified the default <code class="highlighter-rouge">CMD</code>, you can just do <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker run -it
mypython:latest</code>. What do you observe?</li>
  <li>Write and build a Dockerfile that installs the packages <code class="highlighter-rouge">fortune</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">fortunes-min</code> and runs the <code class="highlighter-rouge">fortune</code>
executable (located in <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/games/fortune</code> after you install it). Note that you won’t need to use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-it</code> flags when you run
the container as <code class="highlighter-rouge">fortune</code> doesn’t need <code class="highlighter-rouge">STDIN</code>.
Submit your Dockerfile with this lab. Hint: if you’re having trouble writing your Dockerfile, try booting an
interactive container and installing both packages. Translate what you did into a Dockerfile.
How can you translate what you did interactively to a Dockerfile?</li>
  <li>Paste the output of your <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker images</code> command after questions 1 and 2.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="detached-containers-and-ports">Detached Containers and Ports</h3>
<p>You might not always want containers to be running interactively. For instance, if you are running a web server, you’ll
likely want the container to continue keep running until you explicitly want to end it. Docker supports this use case
with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-d</code> flag, which starts containers in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#detached--d">detached
mode</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll explore a bit about detached containers by running a standalone Apache container. The image has already been
built for you; you can find it on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd/">Docker Hub</a> as <code class="highlighter-rouge">httpd</code>.</p>

<p>Docker creates a separate virtual network for containers, so you will need to do forward your host port to your
container’s port (this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding">port forwarding</a>, or port mapping).
The container is listening on port 80, so let’s try to forward our host machine’s port 5050 to the container’s
port 80 when we run the container:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker run -d -p=5050:80 httpd</code></p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">-p</code> flag takes in a colon separated pair of <code class="highlighter-rouge">HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT</code> (it can actually accept a ton of more
options, but don’t worry about that for now). You should be able to view visit <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;url_of_host_machine&gt;:5050</code>, assuming
you don’t have anything else running on that port (if you’re not on campus, you can just <code class="highlighter-rouge">curl &lt;url_of_host_machine&gt;:5050</code>
from your VM or another machine on campus, e.g. ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu), and see the words “<strong>It works!</strong>”. You may need to allow
the port 5050 on your firewall, simply run the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">ufw allow 5050</code></p>

<p>You can actually “attach” to running containers and run more commands in them, similar to how <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker run</code> works. Use
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker exec</code> command:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker exec &lt;container_id_or_name&gt; &lt;command&gt;</code></p>

<p>To stop this container, use <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker stop &lt;container_id_or_name&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>You can restart the container using <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker restart &lt;container_id_or_name&gt;</code>.</p>

<h4 id="questions-1">Questions</h4>
<ol>
  <li>With <code class="highlighter-rouge">httpd</code> running in a detached container, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">/bin/bash</code> on the same container and paste the output of <code class="highlighter-rouge">ps
aux</code>. Observe that there’s very few processes running as compared to running <code class="highlighter-rouge">ps aux</code> on your VM. Why is this the case?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="dungeons-and-docker-compose">Dungeons and <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code></h3>
<p>Congratulations! You’ve just been hired by some trash SF Bay Area tech bubble startup as their systems administrator.
Unfortunately, both the CEO and CTO are busy handling the business side, which leaves it up to you to get their web
application deployed using Docker and <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code>.</p>

<p>Don’t worry though – while you may not have health insurance or a nice salary, you do have some of the CTO’s notes and
equity to help you with your task. You get off BART at 12pm and enter your cramped SOMA coworking space, sitting down
at the desk you share with the CTO while cracking open a cold LaCroix. Checking your email, you find the following
notes from the CTO:</p>

<h4 id="about-docker-compose">About <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code></h4>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code> lets you define applications that require more than one container to function. For example, on a web
application you may want your actual web application running inside of a single container, and your database running in
a different container.</p>

<p>Typically you define applications in terms of <strong>services</strong>. Again, going with the web application example, there are
two distinct services: the app itself, and the database backing it. <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code> lets you define different services
within a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a> file and run the services accordingly.</p>

<p>One of the nice things about <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code> is that it automatically sets up a network for your containers in which:</p>
<ul>
  <li>each container for a service is on the network and reachable from other containers on the network</li>
  <li>each container is discoverable on the network via its container name</li>
</ul>

<p>This means it should be pretty simple to get our web app to connect to the database.</p>

<h4 id="installing">Installing</h4>
<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code> is really just a python package, so ideally we should just install it with <code class="highlighter-rouge">virtualenv</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">pip</code> (as with most
things, the version packaged in Debian stable is too old, so we can’t just <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt install</code> it).
Feel free to do it this way if you want, but since we’re a hotshot tech startup we’re gonna do this the cowboy way
(yeehaw):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.20.1/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="the-web-application">The web application</h4>
<p>The web application is written only the most badass rockstar tech,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzkRVzciAZg">Node.js</a>. For the database, it uses the most webscale, reliable, and
persistent database available on the market today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs">MongoDB</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.fluffy.cc/bKHw92JKd8fKRgkK73vC881PzkXj4q9V.gif" alt="everything he just said was wrong" /></p>

<p>The web application can be found on GitHub. Note that the web app listens on port 8080, so you’ll need to forward or
expose that port. Don’t forget to allow it on your firewall, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ufw allow 8080</code>. Instructions for setting it up are located in the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> of the repository: <a href="https://github.com/0xcf/decal-sp18-a10">https://github.com/0xcf/decal-sp18-a10</a></p>

<p>For MongoDB, you can just use the image on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/">DockerHub</a> (a website where people can
upload built Docker images). It’s just called <code class="highlighter-rouge">mongo</code>. For example, if you wanted to run MongoDB within a container in
detached mode:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">docker run -d mongo:latest</code></p>

<h4 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h4>
<p>Your task is to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code> to deploy the Node.js app with the MongoDB database. The CTO has roughly mapped
out a suggested order of tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Dockerfile</code> that will allow you to run the Node.js web application</li>
  <li>Write a <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose.yml</code> file that will glue the Node.js app container with a MongoDB container</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is a basic skeleton for <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose.yml</code>. You will need to fill out the <code class="highlighter-rouge">web</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">database</code> service entries:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>version: '3'
services:
  web:
  database:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By default, the Node.js web application is designed to look for a MongoDB instance at hostname <code class="highlighter-rouge">database</code>, so be sure
that your MongoDB service is defined under that name. <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code> will make sure that the hostname <code class="highlighter-rouge">database</code> maps
to the container for that service.</p>

<p>One huge caveat: your hotshot CTO unfortunately wrote the Node.js app in a crap way where if it’s not able to connect
to the MongoDB database once it starts, it’ll fail and exit without retrying. Since Javascript is poison, you’ll need
to find a way to make sure that the Node.js app only starts after the MongoDB container is ready to accept incoming
connections <em>without</em> modifying <code class="highlighter-rouge">server.js</code>. I included a wrapper script <code class="highlighter-rouge">wait-for</code> in the repo for the Node.js app
that will allow you to wait for the MongoDB service to be ready before launching the Node.js app. But, in order to use
the script, you will need to have <code class="highlighter-rouge">netcat</code> installed in your container, so be sure to include that in your Dockerfile.
See the <a href="https://github.com/Eficode/wait-for">repo for the script</a> for instructions on how to use the script. Feel free
to come up with other ways to solve this issue though!</p>

<p>You will likely find the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/">Compose File Reference</a> useful. Additionally,
the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/">Getting Started</a> guide will help as well, although it’s a python
example instead of the superior Node.js /s I suggest poking around at other docs on that site also. I expect you to run
into errors and difficulties – this is intended as part of the lab. Please try googling error messages and coming up
with your own fixes before asking for help, but of course feel free to ask if you get really stuck.</p>

<p>Hints (if you want them):</p>
<ul>
  <li>For the Node.js Dockerfile, I recommend basing it off of <code class="highlighter-rouge">ubuntu:xenial</code> and installing everything you need
(<code class="highlighter-rouge">nodejs</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm</code>, etc.) via <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt</code>. These aren’t in Debian’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt</code> repository so you’d have to find another way to
install them if you use Debian.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">npm install</code> needs to be run within the directory containing the repository (i.e. needs to be run within the
directory that has the <code class="highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> file). If you want to change the current working directory within your
Dockerfile, use the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir"><code class="highlighter-rouge">WORKDIR</code> command</a></li>
  <li>If you change your Dockerfile after running <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose up</code>, you will need to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">docker-compose build</code> to
