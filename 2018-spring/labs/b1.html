<title>Beginner Lab 1 - Unix, the Shell, OSS - Hands-On UNIX System Administration DeCal</title>

<article class="markdown-body">
  <h1>Beginner Lab 1 - Unix, the Shell, OSS</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the first lab! Here are some commands you might find helpful:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">cat, cd, emacs, file, grep, less, ls, man, nano, tar, wget, vim</code></p>

<p>Remember: Google and <code class="highlighter-rouge">man</code> are your friends!</p>

<h2 id="shell-spelunking">Shell spelunking</h2>
<p><strong>Everything should be done via the shell!</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of this lab is to get you comfortable with using the shell for
things you might typically use a GUI for. While these tasks may seem simplistic
or limited, you’ll quickly find that the commands have many different options
(flags) to perform tasks that are either impossible or incredibly tedious /
difficult to complete using traditional methods.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> into <code class="highlighter-rouge">tsunami.ocf.berkeley.edu</code> using your OCF account, or login at
<a href="https://ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu">ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run the following command to download the file we have provided:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">wget https://decal.ocf.berkeley.edu/static/b1/b01.tgz</code></p>

    <p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">.tgz</code> file is actually a composition of two file formats. Sometimes
you’ll see these files as <code class="highlighter-rouge">.tar.gz</code> instead. A common (and old) way of
archiving is with magnetic tapes. However, in order to archive the data, it
needs to be a single file, and often you want to archive multiple files at
once. This is where the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tar</code> command comes in (<code class="highlighter-rouge">tar</code> stands for tape
archive). Tar will group (or ungroup) multiple files into a single one.</p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">tar</code>, unless you ask it to, doesn’t compress files itself though. This is
where either <code class="highlighter-rouge">gzip</code> (or <code class="highlighter-rouge">bzip2</code>) comes in. <code class="highlighter-rouge">gzip</code> will compress your file,
and so, tar + gzip is often used in conjunction. It looks something like
this: <code class="highlighter-rouge">file --(tar)--&gt; file.tar --(gzip)--&gt; fill.tar.gz</code>.</p>

    <p>If you read the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tar</code> documentation carefully enough, you’ll see that you
can give the command an option to compress your files using <code class="highlighter-rouge">gzip</code> as well,
saving you a total of one line of shell command!</p>

    <p>To unarchive the file we provide you, run the following command:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">tar xvzf b01.tgz</code>. This will provide a <code class="highlighter-rouge">b01</code> directory for you with some
files for the rest of this lab.</p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">tar</code> has a reputation for being a bit tricky with its options:
<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tar.png" alt="XKCD 1168" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">b01</code> directory. Make sure you’re in there by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">cwd</code>
(Current working directory). What does <code class="highlighter-rouge">cwd</code> give you?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s a hidden file in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">b01</code> directory. What is the secret?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A malicious user made its way into my computer and added a bunch of nonsense
files. What do the files say? (Hint: They all have the same contents). Help
me get rid of them by deleting all of these files and the directory they are
in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s a file in <code class="highlighter-rouge">b01</code> called <code class="highlighter-rouge">big_data.txt</code>. It’s 80 megabytes worth of
random text. For reference, Leo Tolstoy’s “War and Peace”, the novel with a
whopping 57,287 words depicting the French invasion of Russia and the impact
of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society through the stories of five Russian
aristocratic families with several chapters solely dedicated to
philosophical prose, is only 3.2 megabytes large.</p>

    <p>For that reason, I don’t recommend using <code class="highlighter-rouge">cat</code> to print the file. You can
try it, but you’ll be sitting there for a while. There’s some text you need
to find in there! Go find it! (Hint: It’s a url)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s a file called <code class="highlighter-rouge">trojan_horse.txt</code>. Try reading it. Surprise! It’s not
a text file.  Find out what file it is and what it depicts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, there’s an empty file called <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello_world</code> in the directory. Write
your name in it!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you’re done <strong>remember to fill out the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/H7odCjvpDYslkvSb2">Google
form</a></strong>. There’s some other questions
you’ll have to answer and some feedback we’d like you to fill out!</p>
