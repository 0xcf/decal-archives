\section{Postfix}
Install Postfix on your account on pileup.ocf.berkeley.edu and change the configuration as necessary. Your virtual server should be able to send email (not receive unfortunately). Try and email yourself a message -- I recommend using one of the two text-editors mentioned in notes: pine or mutt. 

\section{Procmail}
Create separate rules for the following assuming your email address is \\{\bf groupxx@pileup.ocf.berkeley.edu}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Deleting all the mail coming from myspace.com on arrival.
\item Send all of the mail coming from your Forestry 125C GSI Bob John (naturebobby@berkeley.edu) to a folder Forestry.
\item Save all of the message that are either send directly To you or Cc'ed From an email from cs.berkeley.edu domain into a folder CS 
\item Send everything that is not sent from berkeley.edu domain to spam

\end{enumerate}
\section{Submission}
Yep. Same way.
