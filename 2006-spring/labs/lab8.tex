\section{PHP}
Do the following on the "root account"
\begin{enumerate}
\item First add mod\_php module to your apache server and find out what it does.
\item Install PHP.
\item Write a simple Hello World php program. Find the syntax at \htmladdnormallink{http://php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.php}{http://php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.php}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Installing a Blog}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a new user and active web-hosting for that account by creating a {\bf public\_html} directory in the user's home directory. Make sure to setup correct permissions and test to figure out how to access the directory from the web.
\item Create a MySQL user and a database. You could use the command-line to practice how to work with MySQL, however, I suggest you install phpMyAdmin first to make your life easier. How do you access phpMyAdmin from the web?
\item Download and configure WordPress blogging software. Use the MySQL user you used in first step. 
\item Install WordPress making sure the permissions on wp-config.php file are correct
\item Create a post to show that your setup works!
\item Set a quota on the user account
\end{enumerate}
\section{Submission}
As always!
