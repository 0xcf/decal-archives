PHP

PHP is a language for creating interactive web sites.
It was originally called "Personal Home Page Tools"
when it was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf to keep
track of who was looking at his online resume.

Mid-1997: Technion students Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski
redesigned the PHP language engine and wrote some of the
most popular PHP modules.

At that time PHP already had its own site, php.net,
run by the computer science community, and was powering
thousands of Web sites. The script was just beginning
to be recognized by developers who preferred the
multi-platform script over its more limited
Microsoft ASP counterpart that interfaces only
with Windows NT.

Today PHP Web developers applaud the script's simplicity,
flexibility, and ability to generate HTML pages quickly.
Over 5,100,000 (1/2001) sites around the world use PHP.
