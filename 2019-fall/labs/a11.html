<title>Lab 11 - Security - Hands-On Linux System Administration DeCal</title>

<article class="markdown-body">
  <h1>Lab 11 - Security</h1>
  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This lab is a bit unique compared to the rest, very little programming is
involved.</p>

<h2 id="getting-help">Getting help</h2>
<p>If you want any help with any part of this lab, join the OCF slack
(<a href="https://ocf.io/slack">https://ocf.io/slack</a>), and mention me (slack: @mdcha, IRC: dongkyun) in
 #decal-general.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-threat-modeling">Part 1: Threat Modeling</h2>
<p>Read the below prompts and answer any related questions. These questions may
take some research and googling. Remember:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What are you protecting?</li>
  <li>Who are your adversaries?</li>
  <li>How likely is it you will need to protect it?</li>
  <li>What are the consequences of failing to protect it?</li>
  <li>How many resources should you devote to protecting it?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="example-safekeeping">Example: Safekeeping</h3>
<p>This one is just for reference, you don’t have to answer it:</p>

<p>You run a safe storage facility for customers to store a variety of valuables.
Describe your threat model.</p>

<p>In this scenario, you’re responsible for your clients’ valuables. There are a
multitude of adversaries, including burglars ranging from smash-and-grab to more
sophisticated attackers, disgruntled employees, clients looking to claim
fradulent loss, and natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires, or tornados.</p>

<p>Storage facilties containing potentially high amounts of valuables in close
proximity to each other may serve as enticing targets for attackers and failing
to protect the facility would result in a loss of trust that would be
devastating for a business.</p>

<p>In order to protect against burglars, an variety of protections can be enabled
from increased surveillance to 24/7 guards. The rational amount of security
depends on the level of desired profit and likelihood of a break-in.</p>

<p>Allowing clients to install their own security protects allows them protection
agaisnt both disgruntled employees and acts as a protection mechanism against
fradulent clients.</p>

<h3 id="illicit-activity">Illicit Activity</h3>
<p>You’re a drug dealer that communicates to your clients over SMS and offers to
take Venmo. You usually offer to meet them at a local park only a few blocks
away from your apartment.</p>

<p>First create a threat model and then determine how to go about your business
more securely.</p>

<p>Secondly, if you were a fed, what tools do you have at your disposal, and how
could you go about building a case against the above drug dealer?</p>

<h3 id="subversive-journalism">Subversive Journalism</h3>
<p>You’re a journalist criticizing the local authoritarian government and trying to
get your story to ProPublica. Describe your threat model and how you would
safely deliver the information.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-network-security">Part 2: Network Security</h2>
<p>Make a list of all the services running on your student VM that are accessible
from the public internet, what user they are running as, and what port they are
listening on. Use the tools you learned about in lecture 6, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">netstat</code>,
as well as tools like <code class="highlighter-rouge">ps</code>. You may also want to point <code class="highlighter-rouge">nmap -A</code> at your VM from
another machine, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">tsunami</code>.</p>

<p>Use <code class="highlighter-rouge">less</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">grep</code> to open up and search your SSH login log file, located in
<code class="highlighter-rouge">/var/log/auth.log</code>. Besides yourself, is anyone else trying to log in? Who?</p>

<h2 id="part-3-hashes">Part 3: Hashes</h2>
<p>Find the checksum for the binary of a software you use. What is the software and
checksum? How did you check the checksum?</p>

<h2 id="part-4-submission">Part 4: Submission</h2>

<p>Congratulations on finishing the lab!</p>

<p>To submit, insert answer you have for each section into the gradescope
submission.</p>
