<article class="markdown-body">
  <h1>Beginner Lab 4 - Debian, packages, compiling software</h1>
  <h2 id="what-is-a-distribution">What is a distribution?</h2>

<p>A distribution is a combination of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)">kernel</a>,
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Init">init system</a>, libraries,
drivers, and other critical software. There are many distributions, for Linux
and other kernels as well, such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution">BSD</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)">Solaris</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-should-i-use-then">What should I use then?</h2>

<p>Currently, there are around 300 actively developed Linux distributions listed
on <a href="https://distrowatch.com">DistroWatch</a>. It might be a bit overwhelming with
so many choices. Popular distributions include Debian, Ubuntu, Arch Linux,
CentOS, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, but in this course, we’ll only be using
Ubuntu.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-ubuntu">What is Ubuntu?</h3>

<p>Ubuntu is a very popular Linux distribution built around ease of use. Ubuntu
is based on the Debian project and and has spawned its own family of
distributions. What defines the Debian family of distributions is the use
of the DEB package format and the dpkg/apt package managers.</p>

<h2 id="but-what-about-these-package-managers">But what about these “package managers”?</h2>

<p>If you come from the Windows or MacOS ecosystems, you might be wondering what a
package manager is. On those operating systems, the most common method of
installing new programs is to run an installer executable that unpacks and
copies files into the correct location, and updates the OS registry to reflect
this.</p>

<p>Enter the package manager, a centralized way to install, update, and remove
software from your computer using verified sources called repositories.  Most
package managers work in the same way: the package manager gets a list of
packages from the repository, and then, when asked to install a package,
fetches the package from the repository, verifies that it is legit, and
installs it. A package manager is like a librarian. When a patron wants to read
a book, the librarian consults a catalog (which is the package database) and
then fetches the book from the shelf and gives it to the patron (installing the
package).  Sometimes, the librarian has to update the catalog because new
editions of the books were added (updating the package database). When the
patron is done, the librarian knows where to return the book (cleaning up after
removing a package).  Contrast this to the approach on Windows, where dedicated
uninstaller programs are occasionally necessary as the OS does not know where
programs install their own files.</p>

<h2 id="ubuntu-an-example">Ubuntu: An Example</h2>

<p>In this class, we will be focused on using Ubuntu. As noted before, Ubuntu uses
<code class="highlighter-rouge">apt</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">dpkg</code> as its package manager. <code class="highlighter-rouge">dpkg</code> was the original tool used for
managing packages on Debian. <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt</code> was created to make managing packages easier,
and introduced the concept of repositories (remote package sources).</p>

<p>We invoke the package manager by using <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt</code>. Before installing anything, you
shoud update your local package metadata list (name, version, etc.) to ensure the package
manager installs the latest and most up-to-date packages. To do that, run:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo apt update
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To find the package to install (note this doesn’t change the state of your computer, so
you don’t sudo to search):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ apt search [package|description]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To install a package, run:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo apt install package
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To remove a package, run:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo apt remove package
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Easy? When you want to upgrade the packages that you have installed when
new versions are released, you can do so by calling:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo apt upgrade
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are also other commands, such as removing unneeded dependencies (dependencies
are other packages a package needs), <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo apt autoremove</code>, and purging packages
(<code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo apt purge</code>). You are encouraged to look at the man pages regarding these commands.</p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>We are going to install the C compiler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection">GCC</a>
for the next step of the lab.</p>

<p>Simply run:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo apt install gcc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now check if GCC is installed by running the following to check GCC’s version:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ gcc --version
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>This, and all other parts of the lab, should be done on your DigitalOcean
student VM, as you cannot install packages on OCF machines.</strong></p>

<p>You should be able to connect to your student VM at <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;OCF username&gt;.decal.xcf.sh</code>
by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh &lt;username&gt;@&lt;username&gt;.decal.xcf.sh</code> and the password you set when
your first logged in, or using the email you received.</p>

<h2 id="but-what-about-software-that-isnt-in-the-repositories">But what about software that isn’t in the repositories?</h2>

<p>Sometimes it happens that a program you want to install hasn’t been
packaged for your distributions, or hasn’t been packaged at all. You have
several options in this scenario to install the software you want:</p>

<h4 id="warning">Warning:</h4>
<p><strong>Installing software not from a repository carries the same risks as
installing software from a random .exe or .msi on Windows.</strong></p>

<p>Linux is popularly considered more secure than Windows or MacOS because of
its use of repositories – but a malicious package installed manually can
pwn your system as easily as malware on any other OSes.
<strong>Use common sense! Only manually install from sources you trust.</strong></p>

<p><em>(For users of Ubuntu: PPAs, or third-party repositories, carry the same
risks of running malicious third-party code.)</em></p>

<p>If the developers provide a package compatible with your distribution (.deb for
Debian-based distros), you can download that package and install it using:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo apt install ./path/to/the/package.deb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Another way is to find a generic binary package from the developer. This can
come in the form of shady shell scripts, or a binary tarball that you can just
extract it and run, or an appimage, which is a special type of executable that
includes its own dependencies.</p>

<p>The last way is to compile your software from scratch. What does that mean?
Open source software must have its source code publicly available somehow,
(GitHub, GitLab, their website). If you fetch their source code, it
won’t magically run out of the box. The source code is like the recipe, while
the software itself is like food. A package is like a dish that is put into a
box but we won’t covering the details of making a package yourself (there are
tools that do that for you and it varies from platform to platform).</p>

<h2 id="so-how-do-i-compile">So how do I compile?</h2>

<p>Compiling software on Linux can be a mixed bag. Sometimes, all the dependencies
(like libraries) are installed on your computer and there is no fiddling around.
Sometimes, the dependencies don’t even exist pre-compiled for your distribution
so you have to compile those yourself in order to compile what’s at hand. Most
of the time, these steps are simplified through the use of a Makefile, which
controls the Make build system.</p>

<p>In most source tarballs, there is usually a Makefile that contains a set of
directives to compile a project. This is because there are usually multiple
files across many directories that need to be compiled together into the
final executable. On top of that, there are multiple settings that control, for
example, optimizations, size of the executable, static vs. dynamic linking,
and whether to link against system libraries or alternatives.</p>

<p>Many projects that have to be compiled are usually in C, C++, or similar
lower-level languages. On most Linux distributions, there are usually three
compiler “options”. There is the GNU Toolchain which provides <code class="highlighter-rouge">gcc</code> or the GNU
C Compiler, LLVM which provides <code class="highlighter-rouge">clang</code>, and Intel’s proprietary toolkit,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">icc</code>. Both <code class="highlighter-rouge">gcc</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">clang</code> are open-source and free software.</p>

<p>To compile software that provides a Makefile, assuming you have the
dependencies, simply type:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ make
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is will usually choose the correct compiler and compile the whole project.
Once the compilation is done, the resulting executables are usually stored in the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">./bin</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">./build</code> directories.</p>

<p>GCC and clang also have compiler flags that allow certain features to be
enabled. Usually the flags that actually matter are optimization flags.
Depending on what you want to optimize for, either space or memory or speed,
there is a flag for it.</p>

<p>Now, we will make a very simple application in C that prints “Hello Penguin!”
named <code class="highlighter-rouge">hellopenguin</code>. Run:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ nano hellopenguin.c
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to create a file named <code class="highlighter-rouge">hellopenguin.c</code>, and type in the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main()
{
    printf("Hello Penguin!");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now save and exit.</p>

<p>We will now compile the source file that you have just written:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ gcc hellopenguin.c -o hellopenguin
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What this does is take the source file <code class="highlighter-rouge">hellopenguin.c</code> and compile it, writing
the executable output to a file named <code class="highlighter-rouge">hellopenguin</code>.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-package-stuff">How do I package stuff?</h1>

<p>Packaging manually for Debian-based distros such as Ubuntu can frustrating, especially
for first timers. That’s why for this class, we’ll be using a really cool Ruby gem
called <code class="highlighter-rouge">fpm</code> (Effing Package Manager) which simplifies the task of packaging a lot.
Please note that if you were going to package for Debian’s or Ubuntu’s own repositories,
this is NOT the  correct/formal way to go about packaging. It is merely a great way
to backport or package your own applications extremely quickly. First, make
sure <code class="highlighter-rouge">ruby</code> and its own package manager called <code class="highlighter-rouge">gem</code> is installed. If they
aren’t, run <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo apt install ruby ruby-dev rubygems build-essential</code>.  Now run the following to
install <code class="highlighter-rouge">fpm</code> locally:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ gem install fpm --user
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Try invoking <code class="highlighter-rouge">fpm</code> and if it doesn’t work, add <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.gem/ruby/2.5.0/bin</code> to your
<code class="highlighter-rouge">PATH</code> (list of directories to find executables). To do that, add this to your <code class="highlighter-rouge">.bashrc</code>, or just type the following into
Bash to temporarily add it to your PATH:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ export PATH=~/.gem/ruby/2.5.0/bin:$PATH
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we will create a very simple package using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">hellopenguin</code> executable
that you made above. First, we will make a new folder named <code class="highlighter-rouge">packpenguin</code> and
move into it:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ mkdir packpenguin

$ cd packpenguin
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we will create the folder structure of where the executable will reside.</p>

<p>In Ubuntu, user-level packages usually reside in the folder <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/bin/</code>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ mkdir -p usr/bin
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now move your <code class="highlighter-rouge">hellopenguin</code> into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">packpenguin/usr/bin/</code> folder.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cd ../ # cd into the directory where the hellpenguin executable is
$ mv hellopenguin packpenguin/usr/bin/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we will create a package called <code class="highlighter-rouge">hellopenguin</code>. Move into the parent
directory of the hellopenguin folder and invoke the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ fpm -s dir -t deb -n hellopenguin -v 1.0~ocf1 -C packpenguin
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This specifies that you want to take in a directory, using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-s</code> flag, and
to output a .deb package using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-t</code> flag. It takes in a directory called
<code class="highlighter-rouge">packpenguin</code>, using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-C</code> flag, and output a .deb file named hellopenguin,
using <code class="highlighter-rouge">-n</code>, with a version number of <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0~ocf1</code>, using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-v</code> flag.</p>

<p>Now test it by invoking <code class="highlighter-rouge">apt</code> and installing it, replacing <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;version+arch&gt;</code>
with the appropriate version and architecture that the package is built for,
which will be provided by fpm when the package is built:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo apt install ./hellopenguin_&lt;version+arch&gt;.deb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now you should be able to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">hellopenguin</code> by doing the following:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ hellopenguin
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If all of this works, you’re ready to head over to gradescope and answer the questions there!</p>
