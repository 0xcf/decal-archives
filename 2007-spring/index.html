<h1>Unix System Administration DeCal</h1>

<p>Welcome to the website for the Unix System Administration DeCal for Spring 2007!  We offer three sections of this course, aimed at students of different ability levels.  For more information, visit the web pages for the individual sections below.</p>

<h2>Sections</h2>

<p><b>All sections share the same CCNs.</b>  Lower division students should take CS 98, section 8, CCN 26389; upper-division students should take CS 198, section 8, CCN 26608.  Note that if you added the class between 5:00 and 6:15 PM on Thu 1/18, we had the wrong CCNs posted (for section 1, "Macintosh Student Developers for OS X"); <b>make sure</b> you are in the correct section!</p>

<p>Note that the time and location given by TeleBEARS and the schedule of classes is not necessarily correct for your section; the times and locations below (and hopefully on the decal.org website) should be correct.</p>
