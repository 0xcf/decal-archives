	<li><span class="date">2007.03.10:</span> The web server has been put back up and everything should be in working order. Don't worry about which path you are using to get to the sysadmin website.

Please continue to use the online submission tool. The quiz given during week 6 lecture and the quiz solutions have been posted.</li>
	<li><span class="date">2007.03.01:</span> Emails have been sent out to the project groups regarding access to the virtual servers. If you did not receive any form of email, it probably means that you have not yet joined a group. Check the list of <a href="index.htm#groups">groups</a> and see if you are on it (using the inst logins). Remember, failing to complete the project results in a NP.</li>
	<li><span class="date">2007.02.27:</span> If you are having trouble logging into the server, please send me an email and let me know. The servers may not be working as they should and we're working on them to get them back up as soon as possible. If anyone still does not have a group, please send me an email, too.</li>
