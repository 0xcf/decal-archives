1. Examine the output of running ldd(1) on a binary linking lots of shared
   libraries.
2. Examine the output of running `objdump -p` (from GNU binutils; might be
   installed as gobjdump on Solaris systems) on the same binary.  Note the
   NEEDED lines.  Do they agree with the ldd output?
3. Examine the output of running objdump on a shared library.  What
   new entries do you see?

The output from ldd (which invokes the dynamic linker to resolve the symbols
in the binary) does not in general match the output from objdump (which
only displays the output from the ELF header), since shared libraries can
themselves depend on other shared libraries.  You may also have noted a
RUNPATH or RPATH line; this controls the search path for the dynamic linker
(see documentation for more details).

Shared libraries have an SONAME field, which is used as the name that is
linked into the binary (in the NEEDED header), regardless of what the file
on disk is actually named.  This is primarily to enforce the use of ABI
versioning (the ABI version is the number usually following .so; for example,
libc.so.6 has ABI version 6).
