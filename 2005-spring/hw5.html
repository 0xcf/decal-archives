Software list - EARLY DEADLINE</A>
</H1>
As a group, form a list of software packages you would like to have available to you on a server.  Some examples include MovableType (blogging software), Gallery (image hosting software), and phpBB (bulletin board software).  Compile a list of at least 3 different programs, and then email it to us.  Since this part is being passed to another group, it needs to be done by Friday (Saturday for the Thursday class).

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
Software support</A>
</H1>
Your group will be given a list of software packages to install, which has come from a different group.  You are now responsible for taking care of the software needs of this group.  Of the pieces of software the group has chosen to submit, you will have to choose at least 3 of them to support.  Installation is usually very straightforward; popular software packages have home pages with instructions on how to build and install it.  This is an exercise with less hand holding than the previous homework, which more or less gave you step by step instructions on how to install software.  This time, you'll have to pick it up on your own.

<P>
Some things you should remember:

<UL>
<LI>Always pass in --prefix=$HOME/decal so the software you're installing goes to the right place
</LI>
<LI>If something goes wrong and you don't know how to fix it, ask.  The worst thing you can do is break something and then mess things up even more trying (and failing) to fix it.
</LI>
<LI>You're not alone.  If you're confused, ask a group member.  Some people are more technically inclined than others, and you should try to learn from each other as well.
</LI>
<LI>If your group gets stuck, you can always reach Matt and I at the decal email address.  We're here to help teach, and if it turns out that a lot of people are having trouble with the assignment we can give more of a helping hand and write directions on a per-package basis.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
After Installation</A>
</H1>
Email us when your group has finished its assignment.  We will notify the group that requested the software that you're done, and they'll try it out.  This means that your group will be notified when the group in charge of your software support is done installing their software.  At this point, you should try it out and see if it works.  Submit a log of things you tried and how it turned out (whether it succeeded or failed).  Have each group member submit individually (you can just copy the log to each member if you worked on it in a group).

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
Potentially Helpful Commands</A>
</H1>
When in doubt, consult the man pages (or Google, which tends to be a bit more helpful when you're first getting started).

<UL>
<LI>cp, scp
</LI>
<LI>tee
</LI>
<LI>While not a command per se, you should read up on input/output redirection (fancy shmancy name for a simple concept; check Google)
</LI>
<LI>tar, gtar
</LI>
<LI>gzip, gunzip, bzip2, bunzip2
</LI>
</UL>
These are general commands that will probably be useful, and by no means are you required to use them.

<P>
Good luck!
