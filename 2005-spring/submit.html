		<h1>Submission Guidelines</h1>
		<h2>Step 1: Set up your account</h2>
		Due to some peculiarities with the way the Unix accounts are set up, there are some steps you will have to take prior to being able to use your account in the way we expect you to.  First, you will have to do the following:<br>
		<li>Log in to your account</li>
		<li>Type in the following commands:<br>
		<code>
			cp /home/ff/cs198/adm/class.login .login <br>
			tcsh
		</code></li>
		<li>Run the register command if you have not done so already, and you are not automatically prompted to.</li>
		<p>
		After this, you should be ready to use the submit program.  From now on, whenever you log in to your account, the first thing you should do is run the command 'tcsh', which starts a shell using the (now) correct environment.  If you've been getting "command not found" or similar error messages when you try to run register or submit, this should fix the problem.
		</p>
		<h2>Step 2: Homework format</h2>
		<p>
		Unless noted otherwise (e.g. "write a script that does..." or "submit your http.conf with..."), your homework assignments should be written up by typing your answers into a text file corresponding to the assignment.  For example, for homework 3 you should put your answers in hw3.txt, for homework 4 use hw4.txt, etc.
		</p>
		<h2>Notes about homework</h2>
		<p>
		Homework assignments are due by midnight of the due date.  If a homework is due on Monday, this means it is due by Monday at 11:59:59 pm.  If you are worried about a late submission, SUBMIT FIRST and then email us.  It's much easier for us to gauge how late you were if you have a submission (all of which are timestamped) than if we have some unknown amount of time between deadline and the time we read your email.
