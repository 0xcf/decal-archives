<p>Welcome to the first lab! Here are some commands you might find helpful:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">cat, cd, emacs, file, grep, less, ls, man, nano, tar, wget, vim</code></p>

<p>All labs are graded on completeness and effort, so don’t worry too much about
getting an exact right answer. Labs are also usually due a week from when they
are assigned. Remember to ask for help if you need it on Slack!</p>

<p>It may be convenient to submit your answers to Gradescope as you go!</p>

<p>Remember: Google and <code class="highlighter-rouge">man</code> are your friends!</p>

<h2 id="shell-spelunking">Shell spelunking</h2>
<p><strong>Everything should be done via the shell!</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of this lab is to get you comfortable with using the shell for
things you might typically use a GUI for. While these tasks may seem simplistic
or limited, you’ll quickly find that the commands have many different options
(flags) to perform tasks that are either impossible or incredibly tedious /
difficult to complete using traditional methods.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ssh</code> into <code class="highlighter-rouge">tsunami.ocf.berkeley.edu</code> using your OCF account, or login at
<a href="https://ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu">ssh.ocf.berkeley.edu</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run the following command to download the file we have provided:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">wget https://decal.ocf.berkeley.edu/static/b1/b01.tgz</code></p>

    <p>A <code class="highlighter-rouge">.tgz</code> file is actually a composition of two file formats. Sometimes
you’ll see these files as <code class="highlighter-rouge">.tar.gz</code> instead. A common (and old) way of
archiving is with magnetic tapes. However, in order to archive the data, it
needs to be a single file, and often you want to archive multiple files at
once. This is where the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tar</code> command comes in (<code class="highlighter-rouge">tar</code> stands for tape
archive). Tar will group (or ungroup) multiple files into a single one.</p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">tar</code>, unless you ask it to, doesn’t compress files itself though. This is
where either <code class="highlighter-rouge">gzip</code> (or <code class="highlighter-rouge">bzip2</code>) comes in. <code class="highlighter-rouge">gzip</code> will compress your file,
and so, tar + gzip is often used in conjunction. It looks something like
this: <code class="highlighter-rouge">file --(tar)--&gt; file.tar --(gzip)--&gt; file.tar.gz</code>.</p>

    <p>If you read the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tar</code> documentation carefully enough, you’ll see that you
can give the command an option to compress your files using <code class="highlighter-rouge">gzip</code> as well,
saving you a total of one line of shell command!</p>

    <p>To unarchive the file we provide you, run the following command:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">tar xvzf b01.tgz</code>. This will provide a <code class="highlighter-rouge">b01</code> directory for you with some
files for the rest of this lab.</p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">tar</code> has a reputation for being a bit tricky with its options:
<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tar.png" alt="XKCD 1168" title="I don't know what's worse--the fact that after 15 years of using tar I still can't keep the flags straight, or that after 15 years of technological advancement I'm still mucking with tar flags that were 15 years old when I started." /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">b01</code> directory. Make sure you’re in there by running <code class="highlighter-rouge">pwd</code>
(Present working directory). <strong>What does <code class="highlighter-rouge">pwd</code> give you (conceptually)</strong>?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s a hidden file in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">b01</code> directory. <strong>What is the secret?</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A malicious user made its way into my computer and created a message split
across all the files in <code class="highlighter-rouge">nonsense/</code>. What does it say? <strong>How did you find the message?</strong> (Hint: <code class="highlighter-rouge">xargs</code> and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code> will be helpful here.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go ahead and delete everything in <code class="highlighter-rouge">nonsense/</code> with one command. <strong>How did you
do it?</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s a file in <code class="highlighter-rouge">b01</code> called <code class="highlighter-rouge">big_data.txt</code>. It’s 80 megabytes worth of
random text. For reference, Leo Tolstoy’s “War and Peace”, the novel with a
whopping 57,287 words depicting the French invasion of Russia and the impact
of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society through the stories of five Russian
aristocratic families with several chapters solely dedicated to
philosophical prose, is only 3.2 megabytes large.</p>

    <p>For that reason, I don’t recommend using <code class="highlighter-rouge">cat</code> to print the file. You can
try it, but you’ll be sitting there for a while. There’s some text you need
to find in there! Go find it without actually opening up the file itself!</p>

    <p>Two lines above the only URL in the file is a secret solution. <strong>What is that solution?</strong></p>

    <p>Hints: What makes up a URL (https…)? What is Context Line Control?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try executing <code class="highlighter-rouge">./a_script</code>. You should get something back that says
<code class="highlighter-rouge">permission denied: ./a_script</code>. This is because files have three different
permissions: read, write, and execute. <strong>Which one does <code class="highlighter-rouge">a_script</code> need?</strong> Change
the file permissions so that you can run the script. <strong>How did you do it?</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, there’s an empty file called <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello_world</code> in the directory. Write
your name in it! <strong>How did you do it?</strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="general-questions">General Questions</h3>

<p>Feel free to use Google and work in a terminal (where applicable) to
verify your conjectures.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What differentiates Linux/OSX from operating systems like Windows?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are some differences between the command line and normal (graphical)
usage of an OS?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the root directory in Linux filesystems? Answer conceptually, as in depth
as you would like,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ls</code> has a lot of cool arguments. Try using them to get extra information such as
file permissions, owner name, owner group, file size, and late date edited. In addition, I
want to be able to see the size and have the files ordered by last date
edited, with the oldest files on top. How would I do this?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of showing the first 10 lines of the file <code class="highlighter-rouge">big_data.txt</code>, I want to use the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">head</code> command to show the first 4. How would I do that?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What’s the difference between <code class="highlighter-rouge">cat foo &gt; out.txt</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">cat foo &gt;&gt; out.txt</code>?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="culture-questions">Culture Questions</h3>

<p>Next are some cultural questions about Linux and Open Source Software.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly, what is the difference between permissive and copyleft licenses?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give an example of a permissive license.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give an example of (a) open-source software and (b) free, but closed-source
software that you use.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
