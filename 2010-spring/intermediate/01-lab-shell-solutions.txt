SysAdmin Decal (Intermediate)
Lab 1 Solutions

Part I

1. Displays all filenames 6 letters long that have a at the beginning,
   followed by any 3 characters, then bc at the end. Uses the 'long format'
   of ls to display all the extended information about each file.

2. Removes all *empty* directories within the current directory.

3. Creates the a/b/c directory tree, creating a and a/b if necessary before
   creating a/b/c. This doesn't happen for free; you need to pass -p to mkdir.

4. Lists the number of files in the directory containing pookie anywhere in
   their name.

5. Reads a list of directories to create from the 'dirs' file, and then makes
   all the directories in that file if possible.

6. List all files below the current directory into a file named 'file'.
   Discards error output.

Part II

1. I got a lot of answers for this, but the most popular ones were

   wget -b
   wget >/dev/null
   wget -q
   wget -o log

   These are all correct, but I was hoping everyone would come up with
   the /dev/null solution.

2. wget -O- www.cnn.com | grep sports

3. wget will always print its progress bar to stderr. If you discard wget's
   stderr with 2>/dev/null, you will not get a progress bar.

Part III

1. The program suspends and the download is paused.

2. jobs will output a list of job numbers followed by what the job is (e.g.
   'emacs' or 'wget'). fg (optionally followed by a %jobname) will resume
   either the job you specify or the job that was most recently paused. bg
   will put a suspended job into the background and resume it. (It may still
   print stuff to the terminal, which confused many of you.)

3. You should have had something like

$ jobs
[1] vi &
[2] wget &
[3] wget &

4. ^C will terminate the program (though sometimes it may refuse to; programs
   may choose to ignore this signal.)

5. Just add an & to the end of your command line.
