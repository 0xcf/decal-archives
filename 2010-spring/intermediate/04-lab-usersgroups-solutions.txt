CS98/198 System Administration DeCal
Week 4: User and Group Authentication

I. Playing with Users and Groups
1a. finger cs198-ti - shows user information for cs198-ti and when he was last
    seen on the computer you're logged into.
1b. w - shows a list of everyone logged on right now with detailed info.
1c. who - just shows the list of everyone logged on; very similar to w,
    just more terse.
1d. last - shows the history of logins to this computer.
1e. id - shows who you are, what your user ID is, and what groups you
    belong to.

2. By default, finger foo will search for foo in everyone's real name as
   well. This takes a long time. If you know the username of the person
   you're trying to look up, use finger -m foo.

3. uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

II. File System Permissions
Only rm file2 and cat file4 should work; all others will return "Permission denied"

III. Free Software Culture - Just For Fun
1. Answer omitted
2a. Your Mileage May Vary - I've given you a solution but it may or may
    not work for you
2b. There's More Than One Way To Do It - The official Perl slogan.
2c. There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch - You must do some additional
    work to accomplish your goal; you can't have your cake and eat it too
2d. Problem Exists Between Chair and Keyboard - *you* are the problem,
    i.e. a mistake was yours alone.
2e. I Am Not A Lawyer - often seen in front of sentences expressing legal
    opinion on mailing lists.
2f. She Who Must Be Obeyed - programmer's wife.
2g. Luser Attitude Readjustment Tool - the thing you use to clobber
    insolent newbies who give you a lot of hassle just when you're trying
    to help.
