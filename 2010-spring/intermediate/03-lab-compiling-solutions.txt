CS98/198 System Administration DeCal
Week 3- Compiling Software

I. Setting Up Users
1. adduser [username]
2. apt-get install sudo
3. Sample sudoers file:
# /etc/sudoers
#
# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
#
# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.
#

Defaults        env_reset

# Host alias specification

# User alias specification

# Cmnd alias specification

# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL) ALL
mgasidlo        ALL=(ALL) ALL
jordan  ALL=(ALL) ALL
sanjayk ALL=(ALL) ALL
alanw   ALL=(ALL) ALL

You could also replace the "User privilege specification" section with
%wheel	ALL=(ALL) ALL
and add all your group members to wheel

II. Shootin' the breeze, Unix style
2. "wall" will write to all user's terminals
3. "mesg n" will prevent others from writing to your wall

III. Compilation Challenge
It looks like everyone managed to get this working, so good job!
