CS98/198 Intermediate System Administration DeCal
Week 7: Network Services

I. Interacting with Mail Locally
1. ``mail'', when run with no arguments, lists all messages in your mailbox
(e.g., /var/mail/mgasidlo); you can select messages by number to read them.
(Read messages are by default saved to ~/mbox.)  To specify a subject on the
command line, use the ``-s'' option -- for example, ``mail -s "Solutions to Lab
7" mgasidlo''.
2. pine and mutt both have easy-to-use GUIs, so you should have no trouble
figuring out how to use them both (and deciding that you prefer mutt).
3. sendmail's ``-bs'' option lets you locally interact with the SMTP server,
much like a telnet session.  sendmail's ``-t'' option behaves similarly, except
it adds receipients specified in headers ("RCPT TO...") to the envelope
recipients (which are specified on the command line).

II. DNS Queries
1. host berkeley.edu.
2. Some are at Berkeley, while there are backup servers located at the 
University of Oregon and at the Internet Systems Consortium. One presumes that
IST wanted to have off-site backups in case the IST datacenter or a portion of
the IST network was down.
3. dig -t NX berkeley.edu, dig -t NS berkeley.edu. dig with no arguments gives
you the root name servers.

III. HTTP
Pseudocode(TM):
set SERVER from input string
set PATH from input string

set BLANK_LINE_SEEN to 0
echo -e "the http request" | nc SERVER 80 | while read line; do
    if BLANK_LINE_SEEN is 1
        echo the line
    elif the line = $'\r'
        set BLANK_LINE_SEEN to 1
done > output

You should be able to figure out how to make a full-fledged bash script from
this.
