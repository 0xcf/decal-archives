<body> <h1>Unix System Administration DeCal</h1>

<p>Welcome to the website for the Unix System Administration DeCal for Spring
2010!  We offer two sections of this course, aimed at students of different
ability levels.  For more information, visit the web pages for the individual
sections below.</p>

<h2>Sections</h2>

<p>Freshmen and sophomores should enroll in the CS 98 (lower division) section
corresponding to their class; students with junior or senior standing should
enroll in the CS 198 (upper division) section corresponding to their class.
Although both sections have the same CCN's, each will have a different lecture
each class, and will have a shared lab period during the second hour of each
class meeting.
