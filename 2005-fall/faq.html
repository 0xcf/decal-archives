<h3>I have little to no computer experience.  Can I still take the course?</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes, you can!  While computer experience (particularly in Linux/Unix, since that's what we'll be working in) will be very helpful, it is by no means necessary.  For the first week or two of class, we'll just be going over basic Unix/Linux commands (alongside other topics).  The class was designed with people who have little or no computer experience in mind, and (hopefully!) will be simple enough for everyone to understand, but still detailed enough for tech-savvy folks to gain something from the class.

<h3>How heavy is the course workload?</h3>
<br>
<p>
The course workload isn't going to be too heavy.  There will be some basic requirements everyone should meet, but those will be made as light as possible.  This course is very self-motivation based, so you'll get back as much (if not more!) as you put in.  If there's ever anything you want to know (whether related to the course or not), feel free to drop by my office hours.

<h3>When/Where are your office hours?</h3>
<br>
<p>We will announce them soon!

<h3>Are there any required course materials?</h3>
<br>
<p>
There aren't any materials required for the course at the current moment, but there are a number of suggested texts (mostly to satisfy your own curiosity).  You can also find all sorts of information on the web through Google (or any of the other search engines), and also from www.tldp.org (for Linux related materials only; tldp = the linux documentation project).  One lesson you will learn while using Unix/Linux is YOU MUST READ.  There is no way to emphasize enough just how much reading there is in learning Linux.  As a side note, if you ever hear anyone say to you "rtfm" that means "go read the manual."
