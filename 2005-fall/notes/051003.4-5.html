<h3>Lecture notes</h3>
<li>I was a little disorganized today.
<li>Servers organize things into 'ports'. To connect to a server, you need to connect to a specified port. For example, web servers usually listen on port 80.
<li>On the server, a program runs that listens to said port (eg 80). An example of a web server program is <A href="http://www.apache.org">apache</a>. It's free, it's popular, it works.
<li>The configuration for apache lives in /etc/apache/httpd.conf (usually, depending on your installation). I went over some highlights, but in reality you can just read the comments in that file. Usually the defaults are fine, and you just need to tweek the things you want.
