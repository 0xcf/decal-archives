		Week 2 Notes
- Sorry for disorganization last time, back to regularly scheduled class. 
REVIEW!
- Got OCF Account? Anybody know a text editor? Filled out the quiz? Night before
it is due? Enroll? Teleberas should be closing soon.

- think of the 2 operating systems as 2 different engines in a car. Each will
have a different effect on the body of the car (computer), will need its own 
connectors (pipes, brakes). 

Learning Curve
- UNIX - exponential at first, then constant
- Windows - linear

- 	Windows 		vs 		UNIX		
Who makes this?
* one private company			* open-source 
	closed source				change whatever you like	
	no modifications		
	a lot of advertising
SLOC
* ~40 million lines of code			6.0 million lines of code
Price
* $$$						free (for the most part)
Server
* Internet Information Services ($$$)		Apache(Free)

[[apache] UNIX]

Distributions
* Debian, Ubuntu - latest craze
* Mandrake, Fedora - traditionally good for start-ups, Fedora used @LBL
* Slackware, LFS, etc..
* FreeBSD
	- different package managments systems

- Distribute Accounts

- login, register
- ssh po to change your password

- How to login from home?

- WTF is SSH?
- SSH stands for Secure Shell It is also a protocol. 
	like name says, a protocol to allow secure connection between two 
		trusted hosts over insecure network
- Web is a chaos. Say you want to get your friend's attention. Not using ssh is
	like screaming the name out, and if anybody wants to, they can easily
		hear you.
- WTF is a shell?
	you probably got a chance to run it, when getting your connection 
		for Rescomp. needed your mac address.
	Well, it is a command line. No GUIs (Graphic User Interface) you are
	used to. 
- Different Shells! 
	bash (bourne-again shell), tcsh (TENEX C shell), zsh, csh (C Shell)..

System Administrator Tools!
- know the commands
- know a text editor
- man = MANual. <- probably most important resource!

Lets Get to Commands!

- UNIX authors were not fans of vowels or long words, so..

- mv = MoVe
- cp = CoPy
- ls = LiSt (not dir in Windows)
- mkdir = MaKeDIRectory
- cd = ChangeDirectory
- rm = ReMove
- pwd = Print Working Directory
- man = MANual (<-- the most important command!)
- apropos ~ appropriate
- touch = create an empty file
- chmod = CHange file access permissions
- chgrp = CHange GRouP ownership

Killing stuff (not really).
- Ctrl-C
- Ctrl-Z
- Ctrl-D

What do CS people do when they run out of names?
- foo -> bar -> baz -> qux -> quux -> quuux -> qu..ux -> shme

Text Editors
- vim (VIMproved), nano, pico, emacs (61a!)
	will teach vi, because it is on most of the systems
	* brave? learn ed!
- Annoying at first, because you have to learn a lot of commands, but after 
	you do, life will be MUCH easier. 

Vi Shortcuts

to get a prompt ':' hit Esc -> :
to get out of ':' hit Esc 
to save file = ':wq', so Esc -> wq -> Enter
	or faster way 'ZZ' ~done and want to sleep
to quit w/out saving = ':q!', so Esc -> q! -> Enter ~q=quit
to insert = 'i' ~insert
to insert at the beginning of line = 'I' ~insert
to delete an entire line = 'dd'
to delete N number of lines below cursor = 'Ndd' -> Enter'
to undo = 'u'
to append to the end of the line = 'A' ~Append
to append after the cursor = 'a' ~Append
to delete after the cursor = 'x'
to search file = '/<insert string to search for>'
to join lines = 'J' ~join
