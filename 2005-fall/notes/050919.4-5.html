<li><b>9/20/2005 5:03pm</b> To do the assignment, you'll need to log into your ocf account that you got last week. For instructions on how to do that, see <a href="http://docs.ocf.berkeley.edu/wiki/SSH_Secure_Shell">here</a>. If you aren't familiar with the unix commands required to do the assignment, take a look at <tt>/bin</tt> using the <tt>ls</tt> command. Try the command "<tt>ls /bin | less</tt>". (since the <tt>/bin</tt> directory has so many files in it, using <tt>| less</tt> lets you scroll through it using the arrow keys. Press 'q' to quit.) Then, if you can't figure out what the command does, use the <tt>man</tt> command to see the manual for that command.
<li>The <tt>.Xauthority</tt> trick should actually be <tt>.Xdefaults</tt> instead. Either that, or after you edit the file, you should run the command "<tt>xrdb -load .Xresources</tt>" (without the quotes). Thanks to Paul for pointing that out.
