1.1 Notes</A>
</H2>

Whether or not you pass this course will be determined in large part
by how well you do on this project. This project is meant to bring
together all the system administration skills you have learned this
semester and to give you a taste of real-life system administration
work. If you have kept up with all the lectures and laboratories,
this project should not be difficult. However, this project will be
different from previous laboratories in the sense that we expect you
to make appropriate decisions by yourself. There will be almost no
``hand-holding.''

1.2 Submission Guidelines</A>
</H2>

Please mail all relevant commands, explanations, output, and information
to dima+decal@ocf.berkeley.edu. It should be clear from your submission
that you understand the purpose of the commands you performed and
can interpret their output. If you feel that some part of your submission
may be unclear, please attach an explanation. The due date for this
project will be announced in class.

2 Final Project</A>
</H1>

The final project will be specified as a series of goals that you
must accomplish. You may accomplish these goals in any way you wish,
although we highly recommend that you heed the provided suggestions.

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Goal&nbsp;1</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Create a new user account and activate web-hosting for that
account by creating a <TT>public_html</TT> directory in the account's
home directory. The directory will require at least user execute,
read, and write and world execute permissions. Determine how to access
this directory from the Internet.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Goal&nbsp;2</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Create a new MySQL database and MySQL user. Although you
may use the command-line interface to MySQL, we highly recommend using
<I>phpMyAdmin</I>, which should be available at 
<BR>
<TT>http://pileup.ocf.berkeley.edu:1##80/phpmyadmin</TT>
<BR>
where <TT>##</TT> is your group's number.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Goal&nbsp;3</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Upload a copy of the WordPress blog software to the user
account you created and extract the files. Modify the WordPress configuration
files to include the MySQL database and user information you created
in the previous goal.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Goal&nbsp;4</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Install WordPress. It may be necessary to change the permissions
on the <TT>wp-config.php</TT> file to allow Apache to read the file.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Goal&nbsp;5</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Create a new post using the WordPress software to demonstrate
that you have successfully installed and configured the software.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Goal&nbsp;6</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Set a quota on the user account.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Goal&nbsp;7</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Write a shell script to backup the home directory of the
user you created. Install this script into <TT>crontab</TT> to have
it execute every day. Ideally, your script should use <TT>tar</TT>
to create the backup. For a challenge, write the shell script in such
a way that each backup file is labeled with the date it was created.
</DD>
