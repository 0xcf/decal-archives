Login and Password</A>
</H1>

<P>
You and your partner(s) have been assigned the following login information
for the project:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>Login:&nbsp;group0

<P>
Password:&nbsp;p4ssw0rd
</DD>
</DL>Your login and password will allow you to connect to your server's
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">virtual console</SPAN> via SSH, and your password is the root password
to your server. You can change your server's root password, but you
cannot change the password you use to access your <SPAN  CLASS="textit">virtual console</SPAN>.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
Server Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
In order to provide the most realistic environment for your project,
we are giving you unrestricted access to your own private <SPAN  CLASS="textit">virtual</SPAN>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">server</SPAN>. For the purposes of the project, the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">virtual
server</SPAN> will behave exactly as if you purchased your own server from
some manufacturer (Dell, IBM, Sun Microsystems, etc) and connected
it to the Internet. You have <TT>root</TT> access to your server;
that is, you have the most powerful user account on a server - there
is nothing you cannot do. For example, as <TT>root</TT>, you are able
to modify any file on the server, and you can even reboot it.

<P>
We have preinstalled Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 ( http://www.debian.org
) on your virtual server. Debian Linux is very similar to Solaris,
the operating system that you have been using on your inst and OCF
accounts. However, some commands behave differently or use different
syntax on Linux; if something unexpected occurs when you're trying
to use a command, please refer to its manpage.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
Connecting to Your Server</A>
</H1>

<P>
Initially, your virtual console is the only method you can use to
connect to your server. To open a connection to your virtual console,
use the following command:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>ssh&nbsp;group0@192.58.221.232
</DD>
</DL>Enter your password when prompted. You'll be dropped into what appears
to be a terminal on your server. In reality, what you see is the system
console, the thing you would see if you plugged a monitor and keyboard
directly into a server.

<P>
You will need to log into your server as <TT>root</TT> using the same
password as before. You are now at a root command prompt. When you
wish to disconnect, type <TT>exit</TT> to logout and <TT>Ctrl-]</TT>
to disconnect from your server.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
Installing SSH</A>
</H1>

<P>
We have intentionally provided you with a very bare server configuration
since most servers will NOT come preinstalled with all the tools you
need. It is often the system administrator's job to prepare a server
for real-world use.

<P>
The first thing you will do is install SSH to provide you with a second
method to connect to your server. There are three reasons why a system
administrator would want to do this:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Remote connectivity. We've configured your virtual console so that
you can connect to it using the Internet, but, in reality, a virtual
console usually requires a monitor and keyboard directly connected
to the server. Since system administrators do not like spending their
lives inside the server room, they install SSH so they can work on
the server without actually being near it.
</LI>
<LI>Redundancy. In the case that the virtual console breaks, SSH provides
a backup method for a system administrator to fix a server.
</LI>
<LI>Multiple Access. There is only one virtual console and only one person
can use it at a time. SSH allows multiple system administrators to
work at the same time by opening a different terminal for each login.
</LI>
</OL>
Debian GNU/Linux provides a very useful tool for managing software
on a server: <TT>apt-get</TT>. <TT>apt-get</TT> can install, remove,
and upgrade software using very simple commands with little intervention
required from a system administrator. You'll learn more about <TT>apt-get</TT>
as you complete your project, but, for now, type in the following
commands:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>apt-get&nbsp;update

<P>
apt-get&nbsp;install&nbsp;ssh
</DD>
</DL>Agree to any prompts and accept all defaults if you are presented
with a choice. If you didn't see any error messages, you have successfully
installed SSH! Wasn't that easy?

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">
Configuring SSH</A>
</H1>

<P>
As you learned in a previous lecture, SSH is a network daemon that
binds to an Internet port and waits for a connection. In the case
of SSH, the default Internet port is port 22.

<P>
The actual server hosting everyone's virtual server only has one IP
address. Each IP address has only one set of ports, 1-65535. Unfortunately,
only one program can control a certain port at a time, and since everyone
is running a default configuration of SSH, everyone will be trying
to take control of port 22 on the server.

<P>
Our solution to this dilemma is to assign every group their own private
range of ports. Each group is assigned 100 Internet ports, <TT>1##00</TT>
to <TT>1##99</TT>, where <TT>##</TT> is your group number, padded
by a 0 if it is less than 10. For example, <TT>group1</TT> would have
the Internet ports from <TT>10100</TT> to <TT>10199</TT> and <TT>group11</TT>
would have the Internet ports from <TT>11100</TT> to <TT>11199</TT>.

<P>
You need to configure your SSH daemon to listen on port <TT>1##22</TT>.
Your SSH daemon configuration file is located at <TT>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</TT>.
Edit this file as necessary (read the manpage or search the Internet
for help if you need it), and instruct your SSH daemon to reload its
configuration by executing the following command:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>/etc/init.d/ssh&nbsp;restart
</DD>
</DL>
<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">
Connecting to Your Server Via SSH</A>
</H1>

<P>
If you have properly configured your SSH daemon, you should be able
to connect to your server from any computer by using the following
command:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>ssh&nbsp;root@192.58.221.232&nbsp;-p&nbsp;1##22
</DD>
</DL>Open a new terminal window and see if this works. Have your partner(s)
do the same. From now on, SSH should be your preferred method for
connecting to your virtual server.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00070000000000000000">
Creating User Accounts</A>
</H1>

<P>
<TT>root</TT> access can be dangerous. The system will never ask you
to confirm a command as root, and thus, it is very easy for accidents
to occur. Consequently, smart system administrators login as a non-privileged
or regular user and only become <TT>root</TT> when absolutely necessary.

<P>
Locate the command for adding a regular user to the server and have
each person in your group create their own account. Once the accounts
are created, you'll be able to log into your server using your regular
account via SSH (as described in the previous section, replacing <TT>root</TT>
with your username). Use your regular account to experiment with your
server.
