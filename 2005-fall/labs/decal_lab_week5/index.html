Notes and Errata</A>
</H1>

<P>
I've noticed that some of you have not properly setup your shells.
During the second week of class, students were asked to input the
following commands into a terminal:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD>cp&nbsp;~cs198-ec/public_html/setup.sh&nbsp;.

<P>
sh&nbsp;setup.sh
</DD>
</DL>
The following week, students were asked to change their default login
shell to bash. If you have not done so or are unsure if you did, please
refer to the Section 1: Pre-Lecture Tasks of the Week 3 Lab for more
information.

<P>
As a reminder, it is in your best interest to complete each laboratory
assignment. Knowledge of and familiarity with every technique and
tool presented in the laboratories will be necessary to complete the
final project. The 5-6 section instructors are here to help - don't
be afraid to ask them for help!

<P>
The lab submission policies for this lab are the same as previous
labs.

<DD>List the top three things that confuse you the most. We'll
collate all your responses and address the most common problems at
the beginning of lecture next week.
</DD>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00022000000000000000">
Log Files</A>
</H2>

<P>
As explained in lecture, log files are the most important tool for
auditing the performance, stability, security, and overall health
of a server. You can be pretty sure that, if something goes wrong,
there'll something about it in the logs.

<P>
All log files mentioned in this section can be found in <TT>~cs198-ec/labs/lab5</TT>.
These log files are actual log files taken from a variety of Linux
servers.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>[1]</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Let's take a look at <TT>daemon.log</TT>. This file is actually
the first 100 lines of a log file I took from a server in Europe this
morning. How is the log file organized? How can you distinguish different
log entries? What is the general format of each log entry?
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>[2]</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The primary purpose of log files is to help system administrators
locate and diagnose errors. Most of the lines in the sample <TT>daemon.log</TT>
are error messages. What is the most common error? Use a search engine
to determine what this error message means and see if you can find
a way to fix the problem.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>[3]</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Sometimes log files can record too much information. <TT>auth.log</TT>
demonstrates this problem. At first glance, it seems that the log
file just contains entries from the cron daemon. However, upon closer
inspection, you will notice that there are a number of entries indicating
that a malicious person has attempted to break into the server. Find
some way to filter out the useless cron daemon entries so you can
find these important log entries. Hint: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">grep</SPAN> can be instructed
to ignore (the inverse of match) lines that satisfy a certain pattern.
</DD>
</DL>
As demonstrated in the previous exercise, knowledge of text manipulation
tools is very important for system administrators. One of the most
popular and powerful programming languages for UNIX platforms, Perl,
the Practical Extraction and Report Language, was originally designed
for the expressed purpose of text manipulation. System administrators
often write Perl programs to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">parse</SPAN> or process log files to
find important log entries and alert them of major problems. You'll
be learning the basics of Perl in the coming weeks.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>[4]</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The last two log files you will be analyzing are Apache
log files. Every time you visit a web page hosted on an Apache web
server, Apache makes a log entry with the time, your IP address, your
request, and other information. Take a look at <TT>access.log</TT>
and describe its format.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>[5]</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Sometimes you'll notice strange entries in your Apache logs.
There are <SPAN  CLASS="textit">worms</SPAN> (malicious automated programs) that search
the Internet for web servers and try to hack into them. Microsoft's
web server, IIS, is especially prone to these worms. Thankfully, Apache
is not vulnerable to most of the worms that target Microsoft servers,
but, as explained in the previous exercise, Apache will generate a
log entry for every request it receives. These attack requests, while
ineffective against Apache, usually result in log entries composed
of strange character sequences. Look in <TT>access.log.2</TT> and
find an example of such an entry.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00023000000000000000">
Shell Scripts</A>
</H2>

<P>
System administrators are lazy people. They will attempt to automate
their jobs as much as possible. One of the tools they use to reduce
the amount of work they have to do is a shell script.

<P>
In its simplest form, a shell script is a file that begins with a
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">shebang</SPAN> line that identifies the file as a shell script and
contains a list of commands after it. For those familiar with Windows
scripting, a UNIX shell script is the equivalent of a batch script.
Traditionally, the extension of a shell script file is <TT>sh</TT>.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>[1]</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Take a look at <TT>~cs198-ec/public_html/setup.sh</TT>.
You ran this shell script at the beginning of the second week to setup
your inst account. What is the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">shebang</SPAN> line? What is the format
of this shell script?
</DD>
</DL>
As you have probably guessed, a shell script is composed of the same
type of commands you would normally type into a command prompt, with
each command on its own line. You should note that <TT>setup.sh</TT>
is a very basic shell script; shell scripts actually support loops
and other constructs that you would expect in a high-level programming
language. If you're interested in learning more, consult the Internet
or O'Reilly's <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Learning the bash shell</SPAN>.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>[2]</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Write a shell script to do Exercise 1 of the Week 2 lab.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>[3]</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Execute your shell script to see if it works. Reminder:
you may need to change the permissions of your shell script so that
you can execute it.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00024000000000000000">
Crontab</A>
</H2>

<P>
Shell scripts are a godsend for lazy system administrators - they
allow system administrators to wrap complex and repetitive tasks into
a simple program. However, a system administrator's laziness does
not end there. For tasks that occur at regular intervals, system administrators
don't want to sit around and wait to execute a shell script at the
right time. Thus, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">crontab</SPAN> was created.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Crontab</SPAN> is a UNIX daemon that executes a command at regular
intervals. It reads a user's configuration file and executes any listed
commands at the specified time or interval. 

<P>
NOTE: Unfortunately, the inst computers have disabled <SPAN  CLASS="textit">crontab</SPAN>.
In order to perform the following exercises, you'll need to SSH into
your OCF account. On the OCF computers, the default editor for the
crontab configuration file is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">ed</SPAN>. Since most of you probably
do not know how to use <SPAN  CLASS="textit">ed</SPAN> or dislike it, I suggest you change
the <TT>EDITOR</TT> environment variable to a more user-friendly text
editor, such as <SPAN  CLASS="textit">vim</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">nano</SPAN>. Hint: You'll need to use
either <SPAN  CLASS="textit">export</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">setenv</SPAN> to set the environment variable.
Please refer to last week's homework for more information regarding
environment variables.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>[1]</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Write a shell script that does something you can observe,
other than generating output. For example, you could write a shell
script that creates a file. You do remember the command to create
a blank file, right? Test your shell script to make sure it works,
and once you have confirmed that it works, reset whatever you had
the script do (ex., if the script created a file, delete it).
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>[2]</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Edit your crontab to execute the command within the next
5 minutes. Wait for 5 minutes to pass and see if the script was executed
by <SPAN  CLASS="textit">crontab</SPAN>. If not, try again or ask for help. 
</DD>
