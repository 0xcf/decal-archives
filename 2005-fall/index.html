<li><b>12/19/2005 9:32pm</b> We have submitted the grades. Thanks for our your hard work! Next semester we will offer a similar class and more. --dima
<li><b>12/05/2005 11:22am</b> 4-5 Section: I'm gonna let the site
manager take down earthquake, so if you've got stuff on there that you
desperately want, take it now or forever hold your peace. Also, if you
have any feedback/flames/whatever you'd like to send me about your decal
experience, go <a href="feedback.html">here</a>, and you can submit it
anonymously. Cheers, all! -jerjou
<li><b>11/30/2005 9:29am</b> 4-5 Section: Okay kids - the time is now.
If you haven't turned in a homework, you've got 7 days. Otherwise, if
your interest has been piqued and you'd like to get better at
Sysadmin'ing, the best way to learn is to do it. Dima came up with a
good list of places to go from here, but I don't have it on me :)
Suffice it to say, if you'd like an opportunity to gain more experience
sysadmin'ing, join ocf staff! We've got people with skills all over the
board - from Unix novices, to people who've been unixing for awhile now,
and there're plenty of opportunities to learn. So if you're interested,
email staff@ocf expressing your interest, and we'll show you the ropes
:)
<li><b>11/22/2005 2:22am</b> 5-6 Section: The Final Project could be found <a href="project/final_project.pdf">in PDF</a> and in <a href="project/index.html"> in HTML</a>. Good luck!
<li><b>11/18/2005 3:10am</b> 5-6 Section: I finally put up week 10 lab. We are still working on formulating the final project -- expect it up soon.
<li><b>10/29/2005 8:45pm</b> 5-6 Section: Hint: for HW7 you have to restart the apache server in order for your settings to take effect.
<li><b>10/19/2005 4:13pm</b> 4-5 Section: Okay, earthquake is back online.
<li><b>10/19/2005 1:39pm</b> 4-5 Section: Someone reboot earthquake into windows, and then Heller lounge closed for a special event this morning, so you won't be able to access earthquake. I'll try to get it back into linux asap. But if you do, I've made the access_log smaller, so if y'all start accessing it again, it shouldn't thrash the machine <i>that</i> much. -jerjou
<li><b>10/18/2005 3:00am</b> 5-6 Section: No HW and Lab does not have to be turned in. Email if you get stuck. --dima
<li><b>10/17/2005 4:30am</b> When completing Week 5 Lab, in order to complete the part about the cron jobs, you will need to ssh into <i>cronhost.ocf.berkeley.edu</i> first. --dima.
<li><b>10/3/2005 10:55</b> I forgot to mention - I went to the SLC Atrium and realized that it's pretty heavily used 12-1, so I'm just going to hold my regular OCF office hours (posted below). -jerjou
<li><b>10/3/2005 10:19pm</b> <a href="hw/hw4.html">HW 4</a>, which is slightly modified from previous semesters for 5-6 is up. If you run into problems please feel free to email me. --dima.
<li><b>9/27/2005 12:07am</b> HW 3 for 5-6 is up
<li><b>9/26/2005 6:59pm</b> I lied - I'll put 4-5 section stuff here, too. -jerjou
<li><b>9/19/2005 10:35pm</b> From now on notes for 5-6 could be found in the <a href=#notes>Notes Section</a>
<li><b>9/19/2005 10:27pm</b> Week 2 Lab has been slightly changed.
<li><b>9/19/2005 10:15pm</b> Instructions on how to SSH into your account can be found <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~eleen/web/ssh.html">Here</a> with the change being that Host Name is solar.cs.berkeley.edu.
<li><b>9/19/2005 7:56pm</b> I've posted office hours below.
<li><b>9/19/2005 7:45pm</b> Announcements/notes for the 4-5 section will be posted <a href="4-5/">here</a>. Read it.
<li><b>9/19/2005 2:37am</b> The lab for 5-6 Section can be found here: <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/sysadmin-class/2005-fall/labs/decal_lab_week2.pdf">Week 2 Lab </a> 
<li><b>9/15/2005 4:16pm</b> We just increased the enrollment cap for 198 section, so everybody who was not able to enroll or was waitlisted should not have a problem now.
<li><b>9/14/2005 8:08pm</b> It looks like people are still able to enroll in the class. I think maybe if you can't get into the 198 section, try the 98 section? And vice versa? Don't quote me on that.
<li><b>9/13/2005 7:12pm</b> We're told that the sections have filled up already. If you're still interested in taking the class, we're thinking of opening up a new section. See <a href="/~jerjou/schedule2/handle=sysadmin">here</a> for potential times, and let us know (ie email sysadmin-decal(at)ocf) how many of those times you can make. If there's enough demand, we may try to open up another section.
<li><b>9/13/2005 12:19am</b> The survey has been posted. Sorry I'm twenty minutes late (having promised it up 'this evening').
