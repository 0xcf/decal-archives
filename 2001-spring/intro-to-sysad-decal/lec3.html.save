<h2>getting an OCF account:</h2>
	Hopefully you've already gotten an OCF account.

	This course will be taught on the Open Computing Facility's hardware.
	If you don't have an OCF account already, you'll need to sign up for one.

	You should have done this on the first day of class.  If you missed it
	you can do it <a href=http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/staff_hours>anytime a staff member is around</a>.
	You can go to <a href=http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/services/newacct.html>this page</a> to get the new account form 
	if you'd rather print it and fill it out at home although we usually 
	have copies in the lab.

<h2>course material:</h2>

	Today we will focus on getting everyone up to speed on basic unix
	commands, and redirection.  If there is time, you should investigate 
	file editors, and email programs.  You should use the class time to 
	find peers that have more knowledge than you in certain areas, and 
	who you can go to for advice and guidance.

	Steve and Gabe will be leading the class, there will also be other 
	instructors around and available to help.

	Below is a list of basic unix commands we think you should be 
	familiar and comfortable with.  

	These links can help you find information about any commands you 
	don't know already.  You can also try asking your peers, or an 
	instructor.

<h2>Homework</h2> <UL>
Due by next Friday (2/23/2001).  Mail your transcript and any questions to 
jones@xcf.berkeley.edu

1)  Create a transcript that shows you understand several of the commands listed above.
Several people have asked, "what is a transcript?"  By transcript, I mean a file that 
shows the output of your session.  <a href=lec1ex.txt>See this example.</a>
Yours will be longer.  You can use the <b>script</b> command to create the transcript, 
or you can cut and paste, whatever works for you.

Don't bother demonstrating knowledge of editors, mail readers, or remote access programs, 
we'll get into more details on those later, if possible, and besides, that will make your
transcript look crufty.
Don't print anything.  
Use flags (options, i.e. "-l" is an option for <b>ls</b>, as in <b>ls -l</b>. 
Do demonstrate the use of input/output redirection.

2) Find another source of interesting or useful information, 
such as the sites and books listed below.  
Google.com's search engine could be useful for this. 
Tell us what the source is, and describe the source briefly.

i.e.<UL>
<LI>www.sunfreeware.com - it has software packages for various sun operating systems.
or
<LI>www.slashdot.org - has news and information about computing and technology
</UL>
Mail your homework, and any questions to jones@xcf.berkeley.edu

<a name=unixinfo>
<B>Sources of information on using unix</b><BR>
</a>
<UL>
The most used source of information on unix commands is the unix manual 
pages.  E.g. to read the manpage for the <B>ls</B> command, you would 
type: "<B>man ls</B>".

The manual pages are divided up into different sections.  Since there are
sections for unix commands and sections for the c programming language, and
other sections for perl, sometimes the section that the man command will
give you by default will not be for the command that you are looking for.  
E.g. for "less," on some OCF sun boxes, "<B>man less</b>" will return the
manpage for a perl pragma (which is found in section 3 of the manpage - the
section that is being drawn from is displayed in parentheses in the upper
righthand corner along with the commandname (i.e. for less, it looks like
"less(3)"), rather than for the unix command.  The manpage for the unix
command "less" is found the section 1 of the manual, so to get at that
manpage, you would need to type "<B>man -s1 less</b>".

<BR><BR>Here are some <a 
href=http://www.cs.runet.edu/~dana/classes/cpsc137/read.html>more 
details</a> about how to read a unix man page.<P>

<UL>
As a side note, the apropos command is useful for finding which section of 
the manual the page you are looking for resides.  ("<b>apropos less</b>" 
finds all the manpages which mention the word less in their description.)<P>

E.g. looking for less, we see there are two commands called less, which I've
highlighted, one in section (1) and another in section (3).<BR>
<table border=2 bgcolor=white><TR><TD>
<pre>
% apropos less
UNIVERSAL       UNIVERSAL (3)   - base class for ALL classes (blessed references)
jpegtran        jpegtran (1)    - lossless transformation of JPEG files
<B><font color=green>less            less (3)        - perl pragma to request less of something from the compiler</font></B>
cldap_close     cldap_close (3n)    - dispose of connectionless LDAP pointer
cldap_open      cldap_open (3n) - LDAP connectionless communication preparation
cldap_search_s  cldap_search_s (3n) - connectionless LDAP search
cldap_setretryinfo              cldap_setretryinfo (3n) - set connectionless LDAP request retransmission parameters
min             min (9f)        - return the lesser of two integers
<B><font color=green>less            less (1)        - opposite of more</font></B>
lesskey         lesskey (1)     - specify key bindings for less</pre>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>Since the manpage for less from section 3 didn't give us what we wanted to
see, this suggests we look at the less manpage in the other section ("<B>man
-s1 less</B>", even though the description "opposite of more" doesn't really
explain anything.

</UL>
<P>

It's also important to know that your shell has built in commands which will
probably not have manual pages of their own.  For example "<B>man set</B>"  
on the OCF will find the command "set" for the TCL scripting language, which
is probably not what you want.  If you type "<B>which set</b>" you will be
told that set is a built-in shell command.  To read about the set command,
you will need to look at the manpage for your shell (e.g. "<B>man csh</b>").  
This brings us to the problem of knowing what shell you are using.  The most 
common default shells are <B>sh, csh, bash,</b> and less likely, <b>tcsh 
or ksh</b>.  You can check your processes and find out which shell you are 
using, e.g. "<B>ps</B>" will give you something like:

<UL>
<table bgcolor=white border=2><TR><TD><pre>
% ps
   PID TTY      TIME CMD
 10380 pts/4    0:00 tcsh
 10362 pts/4    0:00 csh</pre>
</td></tr></table>
</ul>

In this case, the lower numbered PID (process ID) is the shell that the
system gave me when I logged in, csh, and tcsh is a shell I ran later and am
currently using.  To find what the behavior of set would be in my current 
shell, tcsh, I would look at the tcsh manpage: "<B>man tcsh</b>".<P>

Man pages can be difficult to read, an require some getting used to. You can
find information about many commands online.  Try a google search for "unix
command foo" if the manpage is unhelpful to you.<P>

There are some useful unix books out there.  In particular the O'Reilly & 
Associates "Unix in a Nutshell" is said to have a reasonable level of 
information about commands, while not being as confusing as a manpage.

</UL>

<B>There are numerous good books on System Administration in circulation.</B><BR>

<UL>

My favorite general-purpose book is <a href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130206016/>Unix System Administration
Handbook</a> by Nemeth, Snyder, Seebass and Hein.  Now in it's third edition, this book provides excellent coverage of many
routine system administration tasks.  For deeper understanding of a variety of topics, <a
href=http://www.oreilly.com/>O'Reilly & Associates</a> is my favorite publisher.  Their books are nearly always high quality,
and are usually written by reputable sources, and occasionally by the actual creators of a tool.  For example, the most famous
book on Perl is published by O'Reilly and is called <a href=http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pperl3/>Programming Perl</a> was
written by Larry Wall, the creator of Perl.

<B>System Administration Cultural Resources:</B><BR> 

<UL>

The field of unix system administration really does have it's own culture.  Being very computer-centric, there are countless
newsgroups, email-lists, irc-channels, and websites dedicated to the task and the surrounding culture.  This culture does 
have it's egos and social-ills, but by and large is very supportive and genial.<P>
