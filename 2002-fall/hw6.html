<h2>Homework 6</h2><br><br>
This week's homework is simple: Write a shell script that takes in three arguments; a noun, a verb, and an adverb/adjective (in that order).  It's okay if the adverb/adjective doesn't quiiiite fit the sentence, e.g. "yellow hunting" is fine.  The noun and verb part should make sense though, from a grammatical standpoint at least (i.e. if "person" was the noun taken in, don't say "he person me").<br>
Your script should write out a little story (a few lines will be fine).  In essence, you're writing a Mad Libs shell script.  This is a very trivial homework assignment, and requires no programming experience whatsoever (though if you want to throw in for loops and conditionals and whatnot, feel free to do so).  Be creative!  <br>
Commands you will probably want to familiarize yourself with:<br>
<dd>echo<br>
<dd>sh <-- the shell interpreter, try "info sh" if the man page isn't very helpful...sometimes info pages have more detailed information, sometimes they don't even exist!<br>
<dd>if, then <-- for the programmers who want to have more fun<br>
<br>
When you're done, email the script to me.  This assignment will be due 11/12.
