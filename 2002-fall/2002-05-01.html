<pre><h3>Security through "hacking"</h3>

<i>Obligatory note on the use of the term "hack:"</i> My understanding is
that the term "hacker" comes from the MIT Model Railroad Club (see Stephen
Levy's book <u>Hackers</u>), which used the term to describe ad-hoc
futzing with a huge model train setup in the clubhouse.  People that were
taken to immethodical experimentation with the setup were eventually
labeled 'hackers.' Later, as computers proliferated to the extent that
people could sometimes play around with them by breaking into labs late at
night, some members of the Model Railroad Club started playing around with
those computers in the same manner, and the term mapped as was adopted by
the greater community of people that were using computers at MIT in their
leisure time.  All of these people were scruffy and nobody trusted them,
especially because sometimes their experimentations would break the
system.  In computing communities, the term "hack" continues to refer to a
quick-fix or alternately an interesting or clever trick, and the term
"hacker" to a person who is likely to employ a quick fix, or come up with
a clever trick -a person who doesn't go "by the book."  Perhaps because of
their capacity to break things, or because of their irreverent attitudes,
the term "hacker" has, in the mainstream, come to mean a person who
engages in the use of computers towards malicious ends.  Regardless of
malice, the hacker mindset is useful to understand, especially when
considering matters of practical unix security.

To weeks ago we talked about the basic things to do in order to lessen the
chances that your linux box will be broken into by nefarious characters.  
This week we will go over some of the more advanced techniques, and the
supporting resources out on the web.  I'll also tell a funny story,
because security, especially when done poorly, is actually fairly amusing.

to review, some things we already went over and won't be touching on 
today: 

stopping unneeded services (disabling telnet and ftp)
using ssh and scp
the inetd
CGI basics
basic webserver security
the .htaccess model (not a good way to do it)


A great way to understand system security is by understanding the 
techniques and mindsets of those attempting to break into your system.  
The vast majority of hack attempts appear to be either exploratory 
attempts by novice users or bored teenagers, or automated attacks being 
carried out by one of the many microsoft-outlook borne viruses.

These "attacks" are generally fairly unsophisticated, but exploit some
loophole or misconfiguration that is likely to be widespread, and thus
easily noticable from experimental interaction with a hacker's home
system.  For instance, if you ever got a voice-mail box, especially from
AT&T or sprint on your cellphone service, you probably had "1234" as your
initial password.  Some people never change this password -perhaps they
don't realize that everyone else has this password initially, so it's
obvious, or they just never figure out the menu system enough to change
it.  Either way, if a bored teenager tries to break into your voicemail,
that's the first thing they'd try.

<h2>Unsophisticated Techniques</h2>

There are many unsophisticated ways of attacking a system, and in the 
traditional sense, it's a shame to call these techniques "hacking," 
because they really aren't very clever:

<LI> gaining access via defaults
<li> gaining access via common misconfiguration
<ul>
<li> running unnecessary services
<li> running unconfigured/untested firewalls
<li> not running any current anti-virus software
<li> running microsoft?
</ul>
<li> gaining access via well-known problems for which fixes are available 
<dd> note: automated attacks are often called 'exploits,' 
<dd> and their users 'script-kiddies'

<li> gaining access via intercepted information 
<ul>
<li> sniffed passwords
<li> passwords written down in obvious insecure places (on your monitor?)
<li> passwords given out to 'technician' on the phone (social engineering)
</ul>
<li> denying access by flooding aka DOS (Denial of Service)
<ul>
<li> mailbombing
<li> packet flooding (to a machine, or a router)
<LI> service overloading
<li> service confusing
</ul>

A special note on virus software/email.  Many virii use the above methods 
to propagate.  Well known and mostly unresolved problems with the way 
Microsoft handles executable code and address books in Outlook have 
enabled the most widespread viruses of the last several years.


<h2>More sophisticated techniques:</h2>
<li> buffer overflow
<li> setuid
<li> various inappropriate access to data/command execution (perms/shell)
<ul>
<LI> uudecode
<LI> "filename|sh ..."
</UL>
<li> insecure tmp files
<li> coredump/logs with passwords
<li> crypto...


That covers access and propagation, what happens next?  
Typically bored teenagers executing a scripted attack (downloaded from any 
one of many sites on the net) will poke around the system, perhaps running 
irc or stashing some MP3 or pirated software.  More malicious intruders 
will attempt to gain superuser access, and perhaps change your 
web-content, read and/or delete files, and install backdoors.

What's a backdoor?  It's a way of facilitating re-entering the system 
perhaps even after security problems have been noticed and fixed.  For 
instance installing a modified "login" program to accept a magic password 
as valid for any user.


<h2>The Hacker/Security Expert Mythos</h2>

The wild attitudes of malicious hackers and security experts alike have
given the field a strange reputation.  Perhaps computer security's status
as a quasi-legal undertaking, or it's reputation as a lucrative field has
attracted more than it's share of interesting characters.  If you become
interested in this topic, you'll notice a huge range of personalities
publishing material on the web and in print- everything from slick and
businesslike, to hip and in-your-face.  As with most popular areas in
computer science, like animation-graphics and e-business, the people who
are in it just for the money often turn out to be just as poorly informed
and misguided as the poseurs that are in-it to look cool to their
high-school buddies. The end result is a lot of misinformation and in some
cases, mistrust.

<h2>hacker tools</h2>
<li> practices
<li> firewall
<UL>
<LI> sandboxing
<li> sudo
<li> hardening - COPS
</ul>
<LI> automated scanners
<UL>
<LI> crack
<LI> tripwire
<LI> nmap
<li> SATAN
</ul>
<li> monitoring and log analysis
<ul>
<li> active response to portscanning
<li> snort
<li> keeping an eye on outbound traffic
</ul>
<li> encryption
<li> VPN (Virtual Private Network)
<LI> honeypot
<li> anti-spam tools
<li> anti-virus tools
<LI> code auditing
<LI> Forensic tools
<LI> bootable business card

Interesting tidbits:

A very good professional-looking site run by folks who understand the 
mindset of malicious hackers: <a href=http://www.securityfocus.com/> Security Focus</a>

A site specifically geared towards linux: <a href=http://www.linuxsecurity.com/resources/index.html>LinuxSecurity.com</a>

A well made personal site, run by hackers, linking to other like-minded 
sites: <a href=http://www.wiretrip.net/rfp/pages/resources.asp/i2/>Rain Forest Puppy</a>

There is a site called Attrition, which used to keep an archive of defaced 
websites (websites that had their data modifed maliciously).  They 
eventually removed the archive because of complaints from the defacers, 
who wanted more fame and less criticism, and the defaced sites, who wanted 
to escape embarassment and not have their security problems highlighted.

<a href=http://www.insecure.org/sploits_linux.html>An exploit list for linux</a>.
It's interesting to see how many exploits are buffer overflows...
