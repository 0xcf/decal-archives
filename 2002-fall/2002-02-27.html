Perl</a> decal course if you're interested in learning more thoroughly 
about scripting.<BR>

<LI> How can one learn about system administration?
<UL> Summary: It's not hard, but experience is the best teacher.
</ul>
<LI> What are the goals for the class?
<UL> Show you enough that you can install and configure a linux box at
home to be your router, firewall, and personal webserver.  To build a 
foundation with which you could get a job as a student sysadmin.  Students 
requested that we touch on security and scripting.

My favorite general-purpose book is <a 
href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130206016/>Unix System
 Administration Handbook</a> by Nemeth, Snyder, Seebass and Hein.  This
was the "red-book" that I held up in class.  Now in it's third edition
(and has changed to a purple cover), this book provides excellent
 coverage of routine system administration tasks.  The other great
reference book is <a
href=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565922603/>Unix Power
Tools</a>, which provides an easy reference to nearly all the common
commands you might use as a user or administrator of a unix system.  For
deeper understanding of a variety of topics, <a
href=http://www.oreilly.com/>O'Reilly & Associates</a> is my favorite
publisher.  Their books are nearly always high quality, and are usually
written by reputable sources, and occasionally by the actual creators of a
tool.  For example, the most famous Perl text is from O'Reilly
and is called <a href=http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pperl3/>Programming
Perl</a> was written by Larry Wall, the creator of Perl.

<P><font size=+2>Homework for next week:</font><P> <LI> Install Linux on a
machine in the OCF. <UL> There will some crufty old 200MHz machines in
front of the whiteboard.  Use those rather than the gateways, the
flatscreen monitors aren't supported by default in Linux yet, so it's not
fun to use those, and besides, the guys that set those up might get
annoyed.  Install media will be in the desk drawers, feel free to install
over eachother's installations.  Configure as much as you want
(networking, etc. is optional...), but definitely do the basic install.

</ul>

<a name=unixinfo>
<B>Sources of information on using unix</b><BR>
</a>
<UL>
The most used source of information on unix commands is the unix manual 
pages.  E.g. to read the manpage for the <B>ls</B> command, you would 
type: "<B>man ls</B>".

The manual pages are divided up into different sections.  Since there
are sections for unix commands and sections for the c programming
language, and other sections for perl, sometimes the section that the
man command will give you by default will not be for the command that
you are looking for.  E.g. for "less," on some OCF sun boxes, "<B>man
less</b>" will return the manpage for a perl pragma (which is found in
section 3 of the manpage - the section that is being drawn from is
displayed in parentheses in the upper righthand corner along with the
commandname (i.e. for less, it looks like "less(3)"), rather than for
the unix command.  The manpage for the unix command "less" is found the
section 1 of the manual, so to get at that manpage, you would need to
type "<B>man -s1 less</b>".

<BR><BR>Here are some <a 
href=http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/Man-Page.html>
details</a> about how unix man pages are written.<P>

<UL>
As a side note, the <tt>apropos</tt> command is useful for finding 
which section of 
the manual the page you are looking for resides.  ("<b>apropos less</b>" 
finds all the manpages which mention the word less in their 
description.)<P>

E.g. looking for less, we see there are two commands called less, which 
I've
highlighted, one in section (1) and another in section (3).<BR>
<table border=2 bgcolor=white><TR><TD>
<pre>
% apropos less
UNIVERSAL       UNIVERSAL (3)   - base class for ALL classes (blessed 
references)
jpegtran        jpegtran (1)    - lossless transformation of JPEG files
<B><font color=green>less            less (3)        - perl pragma to request less of something from the compiler</font></B>
min             min (9f)        - return the lesser of two integers
<B><font color=green>less            less (1)        - opposite of more</font></B>
lesskey         lesskey (1)     - specify key bindings for less</pre>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>Since the manpage for less from section 3 didn't give us what we wanted
to see, this suggests we look at the less manpage in the other section
("<B>man -s1 less</B>", even though the description "opposite of more"
doesn't really explain anything.

</UL>
<P>

It's also important to know that your shell has built in commands which
will probably not have manual pages of their own.  For example "<B>man
set</B>"  on the OCF will find the command "set" for the TCL scripting
language, which is probably not what you want.  If you type "<B>which
set</b>" you will be told that set is a built-in shell command.  To
read about the set command, you will need to look at the manpage for
your shell (e.g. "<B>man csh</b>").<P>

This brings us to the problem of knowing what shell you are using.  
The most common default shells are <B>sh, csh, bash,</b> and less
likely, <b>tcsh, zsh or ksh</b>.  You can check your processes and find
out which shell you are using, e.g. "<B>ps</B>" will give you something
like:

<UL>
<table bgcolor=white border=2><TR><TD><pre>
% ps
   PID TTY      TIME CMD
 10380 pts/4    0:00 tcsh
 10362 pts/4    0:00 csh</pre>
</td></tr></table>
</ul>

In this case, the lower numbered PID (process ID) is the shell that the
system gave me when I logged in, csh, and tcsh is a shell I ran later and 
am
currently using.  To find what the behavior of set would be in my current 
shell, tcsh, I would look at the tcsh manpage: "<B>man tcsh</b>".<P>

Man pages can be difficult to read, an require some getting used to. You 
can
find information about many commands online.  Try a google search for 
"unix
command foo" if the manpage is unhelpful to you.<P>

There are some useful unix books out there.  In particular the "Unix Power
Tools" mentioned above and the O'Reilly & Associates "Unix in a Nutshell"
is said to have a reasonable level of information about commands, while
not being as confusing as a manpage.
