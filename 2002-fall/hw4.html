<h2>Homework 4</h2><br><br>

This week's homework assignment consists of two tasks.  Be aware; these tasks will take a good deal of time, but most of it is NON-INTERACTIVE, i.e. you let it go and do your own thing and just make sure it doesn't die.<br><br>

Task 1: Install apache somewhere.  Bonus points for getting SSL and PHP in there too.<br>
Task 2: Install something from source.  You can either do this using rpm or config/make files.<br><br>

<p>
<h3>Note: Most sys admins will consider installing and running a process like apache a VIOLATION OF SECURITY.  Make sure it's okay with your sys admin before you do it.  The OCF lab does allow you to run local daemons, provided you follow <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/OCF/policies/Unattended_Processes.html">this</a> policy.</h3></p>


Potential questions:<br><br>

1. What's the motivation for doing this assignment?<br><br>

<dd>Given that apache is more or less the de facto webserver software for *nix, it only makes sense to install it.  Installing software from source is to get you familiar with the process of turning code into binary programs.  Further, compiling your own software (as opposed to simply installing binary packages) optimizes the code for your system, and this is good.  Most pre-compiled software you'll come across using on the x86 platform is compiled for a 386, which means all the nifty things about that processor you blew a hundred odd dollars on are DOING NOTHING.  They're probably crying their poor eyes out knowing how neglected they are.  The poor registers.<br><br>

2. How do we show you we've done the assignment?<br><br>

<dd>Send me a URL, or go to the website yourself, take a screen capture of the screen (usually with the print screen button, if you're using Windows), and then save it as a jpg (make sure it's under 50kb!) and then email it to me.<br><br>

3. I'm totally lost!  Where do I go for help?<br><br>

<dd>You can always ask me for help, or you can go to <a href="http://www.tldp.org">http://www.tldp.org</a> and look at their apache docs.  Also, don't forget to check the apache website.
