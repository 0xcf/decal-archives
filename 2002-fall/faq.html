<h3>Help!  Telebears is closed!  How do I enroll?</h3>
<br>
<p>
Now that telebears is closed, the only way to enroll is to get an add/drop form and bring it with you to class.  Since the majority of you probably aren't enrolled yet (since the CCN was released late Friday), I'll be expecting a torrent of paperwork the first day and will make an effort to find some forms I can bring with me to class the first day.  If you'd like to enroll earlier and get it out of the way, feel free to drop by my office hours on Thursday (which are posted on the ocf staff webpage).
</p>
<br>
<h3>I have little to no computer experience.  Can I still take the course?</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes, you can!  While computer experience (particularly in Linux/Unix, since that's what we'll be working in) will be very helpful, it is by no means necessary.  For the first week or two of class, we'll just be going over basic Unix/Linux commands (alongside other topics).  The class was designed with people who have little or no computer experience in mind, and (hopefully!) will be simple enough for everyone to understand, but still detailed enough for tech-savvy folks to gain something from the class.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Is there still room for me to enroll?</h3>
<br>
<p>
That question's hard to answer, given that exact enrollment numbers and information is unavailable at the moment.  HOWEVER!  If there is room to physically fit you (comfortably) in the class, you'll get in.
</p>
<br>
<h3>When/Where will the class be held?</h3>
The class is currently going through administrative details, and an announcementon the time and place will be posted as soon as arrangements have been made.  Please check the website regularly for updates.
</p>
<br>
<h3>How heavy is the course workload?</h3>
<br>
<p>
The course workload isn't going to be too heavy.  There will be some basic requirements everyone should meet, but those will be made as light as possible.  This course if very self-motivation based, so you'll get back as much (if not more!) as you put in.  If there's ever anything you want to know (whether related to the course or not), feel free to drop by my office hours.
</p>
<br>
<h3>When/Where are your office hours?</h3>
<br>
<p>
You can find my office hours posted on the OCF staff hours website.  I'm actually not holding that many office hours because they're for general OCF'ness, but I will be adding some as the course begins.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Are there any required course materials?</h3>
<br>
<p>
There aren't any materials required for the course at the current moment, but there are a number of suggested texts (mostly to satisfy your own curiosity).  You can also find all sorts of information on the web through Google (or any of the other search engines), and also from www.tldp.org (for Linux related materials only; tldp = the linux documentation project).  One lesson you will learn while using Unix/Linux is YOU MUST READ.  There is no way to emphasize enough just how much reading there is in learning Linux.  As a side note, if you ever hear anyone say to you "rtfm" that means "go read the manual."
