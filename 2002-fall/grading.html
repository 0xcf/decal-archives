<h2>Grading Policy</h2>
<br><br><br>

<p>The grading policy for the class breaks down as follows:</p>
<br>
<p><a href="#at">Attendance</a>: 15%</p>
<p><a href="#pro">Projects</a>: 40%</p>
<p><a href="#ho">Homework</a>: 20%</p>
<p><a href="#pre">Presentations</a>: 25%</p>
<br>
<a name=at>
<p><b>Attendance:</b> Attendance is mandatory for the class, although exceptions will be made for those with extenuating circumstances.  One absence will be excused with no penalties (with only 9 class sessions, that would be more than 10% absnce!)</p>
<a name=pro>
<p><b>Projects:</b> There will be one project that everyone must complete this semester: setting up a webserver.  "But wait, I don't know how to do that!" you say...but that's why you're taking the course :)  "What if I don't have a computer?"  There will be a machine set aside in the OCF lab for the sys admin class to use.  There will be some pre-planning, installation/configuration documenting, and (possibly) some post-install work.  Details will be announced in class.</p>
<a name=ho>
<p><b>Homework:</b> Weekly homework assignments will be announced at each class session, and will be posted online as well.  They are due by the following class session, and you may either submit them 1) online; or 2) in person on paper.  Paper submissions will be returned with comments, and online submissions will be credited only.  So if you would like me to give you some feedback, bring me a paper printout of the homework assignment (if it makes sense to do so)</p>
<a name=pre>
<p><b>Presentations:</b> As an experiment in educational methods, this semester we will be trying out having you teach each other.  In groups of four or five, you will decide on a relevant topic to present to the class.  Presentations should last at least five minutes and at most fifteen minutes.  These will begin approximately three to four weeks into the semester, and we will open each class session with a presentation.  The method behind this madness is the hope that by having you teach each other, you'll be able to gain a better understanding of the material yourself (as they say, nothing helps you learn more than teaching), as well as expanding your breadth of knowledge.
