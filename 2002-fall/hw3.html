<h2>Homework 3</h2><br><br>
This week's homework will be relatively simple (and late).  All you have to do is either a) download; or b) copy the vi-tutor.txt file <a href="vi-tutor.txt">here</a> to your home directory, and then issue the command:<br><br>
<code>vi vi-tutor.txt</code><br>
<br>
Then just follow the directions in the file.  Once you're done, gzip the file with:<br><br>

<code>gzip vi-tutor.txt</code><br><br>

And then email it to me at aoshi@ocf.berkeley.edu<br>
You can use your favorite email client, be it pine, eudora, outlook express (virus exploits galore!), mutt, or if you're really hardcore, mail.  Be sure you follow the steps in the vi-tutor.txt file EXACTLY, as the homework will be autograded.
